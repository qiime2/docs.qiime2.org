     This visualizer compares the feature composition of pairs of observed and
     expected samples containing the same sample ID in two separate feature
     tables. Typically, feature composition will consist of taxonomy
     classifications or other semicolon-delimited feature annotations. Taxon
     accuracy rate, taxon detection rate, and linear regression scores between
     expected and observed observations are calculated at each semicolon-
     delimited rank, and plots of per-level accuracy and observation
     correlations are plotted. A histogram of distance between false positive
     observations and the nearest expected feature is also generated, where
     distance equals the number of rank differences between the observed
     feature and the nearest common lineage in the expected feature. This
     visualizer is most suitable for testing per-run data quality on sequencing
     runs that contain mock communities or other samples with known
     composition. Also suitable for sanity checks of bioinformatics pipeline
     performance.
