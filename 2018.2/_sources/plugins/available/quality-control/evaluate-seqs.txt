         <pre>Usage: qiime quality-control evaluate-seqs [OPTIONS]

     This action aligns a set of query (e.g., observed) sequences against a set
     of reference (e.g., expected) sequences to evaluate the quality of
     alignment. The intended use is to align observed sequences against
     expected sequences (e.g., from a mock community) to determine the
     frequency of mismatches between observed sequences and the most similar
     expected sequences, e.g., as a measure of sequencing/method error.
     However, any sequences may be provided as input to generate a report on
     pairwise alignment quality against a set of reference sequences.

   Options:
     --i-query-sequences ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     Sequences to test for exclusion  [required]
     --i-reference-sequences ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     Reference sequences to align against feature
                                     sequences  [required]
     --p-show-alignments / --p-no-show-alignments
                                     Option to plot pairwise alignments of query
                                     sequences and their top hits.  [default:
                                     False]
     --o-visualization VISUALIZATION PATH
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]
