         <pre>Usage: qiime longitudinal first-distances [OPTIONS]

     Calculates first distances between sequential states for samples collected
     from individual subjects sampled repeatedly at two or more states. This
     method is similar to the "first differences" method, except that it
     requires a distance matrix as input and calculates first differences as
     distances between successive states. Outputs a data series of first
     distances for each individual subject at each sequential pair of states,
     labeled by the SampleID of the second state (e.g., paired distances
     between time 0 and time 1 would be labeled by the SampleIDs at time 1).
     This file can be used as input to linear mixed effects models or other
     longitudinal or diversity methods to compare changes in first distances
     across time or among groups of subjects. Also supports distance from
     baseline (or other static comparison state) by setting the "baseline"
     parameter.

   Options:
     --i-distance-matrix ARTIFACT PATH DistanceMatrix
                                     Matrix of distances between pairs of
                                     samples.  [required]
     --m-metadata-file MULTIPLE PATH
                                     Metadata file or artifact viewable as
                                     metadata. This option may be supplied
                                     multiple times to merge metadata. Sample
                                     metadata file containing

                                     Time) across which samples are paired.
                                     [required]
     --p-individual-id-column TEXT   Metadata column containing IDs for
                                     individual subjects.  [required]
     --p-baseline FLOAT              A value listed in the state_column metadata
                                     column against which all other states should
                                     be compared. Toggles calculation of static
                                     distances instead of first distances (which
                                     are calculated if no value is given for
                                     baseline). If a "baseline" value is
                                     provided, sample distances at each state are
                                     compared against the baseline state, instead
                                     of the previous state. Must be a value
                                     listed in the state_column.  [optional]
     --p-replicate-handling [drop|random|error]
                                     Choose how replicate samples are handled. If
                                     replicates are detected, "error" causes
                                     method to fail; "drop" will discard all
                                     replicated samples; "random" chooses one
                                     representative at random from among
                                     replicates.  [default: error]

                                     Series of first distances.  [required if not
                                     passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.

     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]

   Parameters
   ----------
   distance_matrix : DistanceMatrix
       Matrix of distances between pairs of samples.
   metadata : Metadata
       Sample metadata file containing individual_id_column.
   state_column : Str
       Metadata column containing state (e.g., Time) across which samples are
       paired.
   individual_id_column : Str
       Metadata column containing IDs for individual subjects.
   baseline : Float, optional
       A value listed in the state_column metadata column against which all
       other states should be compared. Toggles calculation of static
       distances instead of first distances (which are calculated if no value
       is given for baseline). If a "baseline" value is provided, sample
       distances at each state are compared against the baseline state,
       instead of the previous state. Must be a value listed in the
       state_column.
   replicate_handling : Str % Choices({'drop', 'error', 'random'}), optional
       Choose how replicate samples are handled. If replicates are detected,
       "error" causes method to fail; "drop" will discard all replicated
       samples; "random" chooses one representative at random from among
       replicates.

   Returns
   -------
   first_distances : SampleData[FirstDifferences]
       Series of first distances.</pre>
