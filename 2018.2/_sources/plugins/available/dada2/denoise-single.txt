     This method denoises single-end sequences, dereplicates them, and filters
     chimeras.

   Options:
     --i-demultiplexed-seqs ARTIFACT PATH SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality | SequencesWithQuality]
                                     The single-end demultiplexed sequences to be
                                     denoised.  [required]
     --p-trunc-len INTEGER           Position at which sequences should be
                                     truncated due to decrease in quality. This
                                     truncates the 3' end of the of the input
                                     sequences, which will be the bases that were
                                     sequenced in the last cycles. Reads that are
                                     shorter than this value will be discarded.
                                     If 0 is provided, no truncation or length
                                     filtering will be performed  [required]
     --p-trim-left INTEGER           Position at which sequences should be
                                     trimmed due to low quality. This trims the
                                     5' end of the of the input sequences, which
                                     will be the bases that were sequenced in the
                                     first cycles.  [default: 0]
     --p-max-ee FLOAT                Reads with number of expected errors higher
                                     than this value will be discarded.
                                     [default: 2.0]
     --p-trunc-q INTEGER             Reads are truncated at the first instance of
                                     a quality score less than or equal to this
                                     value. If the resulting read is then shorter
                                     than `trunc_len`, it is discarded.
                                     [default: 2]
     --p-chimera-method [consensus|pooled|none]
                                     The method used to remove chimeras. "none":
                                     No chimera removal is performed. "pooled":
                                     All reads are pooled prior to chimera
                                     detection. "consensus": Chimeras are
                                     detected in samples individually, and
                                     sequences found chimeric in a sufficient
                                     fraction of samples are removed.  [default:
                                     consensus]
     --p-min-fold-parent-over-abundance FLOAT
                                     The minimum abundance of potential parents
                                     of a sequence being tested as chimeric,
                                     expressed as a fold-change versus the
                                     abundance of the sequence being tested.
                                     Values should be greater than or equal to 1
                                     (i.e. parents should be more abundant than
                                     the sequence being tested). This parameter
                                     has no effect if chimera_method is "none".
                                     [default: 1.0]
     --p-n-threads INTEGER           The number of threads to use for
                                     multithreaded processing. If 0 is provided,
                                     all available cores will be used.  [default:
                                     1]
     --p-n-reads-learn INTEGER       The number of reads to use when training the
                                     error model. Smaller numbers will result in
                                     a shorter run time but a less reliable error
                                     model.  [default: 1000000]
     --p-hashed-feature-ids / --p-no-hashed-feature-ids
                                     If true, the feature ids in the resulting
                                     table will be presented as hashes of the
                                     sequences defining each feature. The hash
                                     will always be the same for the same
                                     sequence so this allows feature tables to be
                                     merged across runs of this method. You
                                     should only merge tables if the exact same
                                     parameters are used for each run.  [default:
                                     True]
     --o-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     The resulting feature table.  [required if
                                     not passing --output-dir]
     --o-representative-sequences ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     The resulting feature sequences. Each
                                     feature in the feature table will be
                                     represented by exactly one sequence.
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]

         <pre>Denoise and dereplicate single-end sequences

   This method denoises single-end sequences, dereplicates them, and filters
   chimeras.

   Parameters
   ----------
   demultiplexed_seqs : SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality | SequencesWithQuality]
       The single-end demultiplexed sequences to be denoised.
   trunc_len : Int
       Position at which sequences should be truncated due to decrease in
       quality. This truncates the 3' end of the of the input sequences, which
       will be the bases that were sequenced in the last cycles. Reads that
       are shorter than this value will be discarded. If 0 is provided, no
       truncation or length filtering will be performed
   trim_left : Int, optional
       Position at which sequences should be trimmed due to low quality. This
       trims the 5' end of the of the input sequences, which will be the bases
       that were sequenced in the first cycles.
   max_ee : Float, optional
       Reads with number of expected errors higher than this value will be
       discarded.
   trunc_q : Int, optional
       Reads are truncated at the first instance of a quality score less than
       or equal to this value. If the resulting read is then shorter than
       `trunc_len`, it is discarded.
   chimera_method : Str % Choices({'consensus', 'none', 'pooled'}), optional
       The method used to remove chimeras. "none": No chimera removal is
       performed. "pooled": All reads are pooled prior to chimera detection.
       "consensus": Chimeras are detected in samples individually, and
       sequences found chimeric in a sufficient fraction of samples are
       removed.
   min_fold_parent_over_abundance : Float, optional
       The minimum abundance of potential parents of a sequence being tested
       as chimeric, expressed as a fold-change versus the abundance of the
       sequence being tested. Values should be greater than or equal to 1
       (i.e. parents should be more abundant than the sequence being tested).
       This parameter has no effect if chimera_method is "none".
   n_threads : Int, optional
       The number of threads to use for multithreaded processing. If 0 is
       provided, all available cores will be used.
   n_reads_learn : Int, optional
       The number of reads to use when training the error model. Smaller
       numbers will result in a shorter run time but a less reliable error
       model.
   hashed_feature_ids : Bool, optional
       If true, the feature ids in the resulting table will be presented as
       hashes of the sequences defining each feature. The hash will always be
       the same for the same sequence so this allows feature tables to be
       merged across runs of this method. You should only merge tables if the
       exact same parameters are used for each run.

   Returns
   -------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The resulting feature table.
   representative_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The resulting feature sequences. Each feature in the feature table will
       be represented by exactly one sequence.</pre>
