     This visualizer compares a pair of observed and expected taxonomic
     assignments to calculate precision, recall, and F-measure at each
     taxonomic level, up to maximum level specified by the depth parameter.
     These metrics are calculated at each semicolon-delimited rank. This action
     is useful for comparing the accuracy of taxonomic assignment, e.g.,
     between different taxonomy classifiers or other bioinformatics methods.
     Expected taxonomies should be derived from simulated or mock community
     sequences that have known taxonomic affiliations.

   This visualizer compares a pair of observed and expected taxonomic
   assignments to calculate precision, recall, and F-measure at each taxonomic
   level, up to maximum level specified by the depth parameter. These metrics
   are calculated at each semicolon-delimited rank. This action is useful for

   ----------
   expected_taxa : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Expected taxonomic assignments
   observed_taxa : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Observed taxonomic assignments
   feature_table : FeatureTable[RelativeFrequency], optional
       Optional feature table containing relative frequency of each feature,
       used to weight accuracy scores by frequency. Must contain all features
       found in expected and/or observed taxa. Features found in the table but
       not the expected/observed taxa will be dropped prior to analysis.
   depth : Int

       root, 7 = species for the greengenes reference sequence database).
   palette : Str % Choices({'Accent', 'Dark2', 'Paired', 'Pastel1', 'Pastel2', 'Set1', 'Set2', 'Set3', 'inferno', 'magma', 'plasma', 'rainbow', 'tab10', 'tab20', 'tab20b', 'tab20c', 'terrain', 'viridis'}), optional
       Color palette to utilize for plotting.
   require_exp_ids : Bool, optional
       Require that all features found in observed taxa must be found in
       expected taxa or raise error.
   require_obs_ids : Bool, optional
       Require that all features found in expected taxa must be found in
       observed taxa or raise error.
   sample_id : Str, optional
       Optional sample ID to use for extracting frequency data from feature
       table, and for labeling accuracy results. If no sample_id is provided,
