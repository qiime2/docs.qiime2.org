     Classify reads by taxon using a fitted classifier.

   Options:
     --i-reads ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     The feature data to be classified.
                                     [required]
     --i-classifier ARTIFACT PATH TaxonomicClassifier
                                     The taxonomic classifier for classifying the
                                     reads.  [required]
     --p-reads-per-batch INTEGER RANGE
                                     Number of reads to process in each batch. If
                                     0, this parameter is autoscaled to the
                                     number of query sequences / n_jobs.
                                     [default: 0]
     --p-n-jobs INTEGER              The maximum number of concurrently worker
                                     processes. If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is
                                     given, no parallel computing code is used at
                                     all, which is useful for debugging. For
                                     n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are
                                     used. Thus for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but one
                                     are used.  [default: 1]
     --p-pre-dispatch TEXT           "all" or expression, as in "3*n_jobs". The
                                     number of batches (of tasks) to be pre-
                                     dispatched.  [default: 2*n_jobs]
     --p-confidence FLOAT            Confidence threshold for limiting taxonomic
                                     depth. Provide -1 to disable confidence
                                     calculation, or 0 to calculate confidence
                                     but not apply it to limit the taxonomic
                                     depth of the assignments.  [default: 0.7]
     --p-read-orientation [reverse-complement|same]
                                     Direction of reads with respect to reference
                                     sequences. same will cause reads to be
                                     classified unchanged; reverse-complement
                                     will cause reads to be reversed and
                                     complemented prior to classification.
                                     Default is to autodetect based on the
                                     confidence estimates for the first 100
                                     reads.  [optional]
     --o-classification ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Taxonomy]
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]

         <pre>Pre-fitted sklearn-based taxonomy classifier

   Classify reads by taxon using a fitted classifier.

   Parameters
   ----------
   reads : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The feature data to be classified.
   classifier : TaxonomicClassifier
       The taxonomic classifier for classifying the reads.
   reads_per_batch : Int % Range(0, None), optional
       Number of reads to process in each batch. If 0, this parameter is
       autoscaled to the number of query sequences / n_jobs.
   n_jobs : Int, optional
       The maximum number of concurrently worker processes. If -1 all CPUs are
       used. If 1 is given, no parallel computing code is used at all, which
       is useful for debugging. For n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are
       used. Thus for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but one are used.
   pre_dispatch : Str, optional
       "all" or expression, as in "3*n_jobs". The number of batches (of tasks)
       to be pre-dispatched.
   confidence : Float, optional
       Confidence threshold for limiting taxonomic depth. Provide -1 to
       disable confidence calculation, or 0 to calculate confidence but not
       apply it to limit the taxonomic depth of the assignments.
   read_orientation : Str % Choices({'reverse-complement', 'same'}), optional
       Direction of reads with respect to reference sequences. same will cause
       reads to be classified unchanged; reverse-complement will cause reads
       to be reversed and complemented prior to classification. Default is to
       autodetect based on the confidence estimates for the first 100 reads.
