     Given a feature table and the associated feature sequences, cluster the
     features against a reference database based on user-specified percent
     identity threshold of their sequences. This is not a general-purpose
     closed-reference clustering method, but rather is intended to be used for
     clustering the results of quality-filtering/dereplication methods, such as
     DADA2, or for re-clustering a FeatureTable at a lower percent identity
     than it was originally clustered at. When a group of features in the input
     table are clustered into a single feature, the frequency of that single
     feature in a given sample is the sum of the frequencies of the features
     that were clustered in that sample. Feature identifiers will be inherited
     from the centroid feature of each cluster. See the vsearch documentation
     for details on how sequence clustering is performed.

                                     should be performed. This parameter maps to

                                     features, relabeled by the reference IDs.

   perc_identity : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_start=False, inclusive_end=True)
       The percent identity at which clustering should be performed. This

       Search plus (i.e., forward) or both (i.e., forward and reverse
       complement) strands.
   threads : Int % Range(0, 256, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The number of threads to use for computation. Passing 0 will launch one

   -------
   clustered_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The table following clustering of features.
   clustered_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
