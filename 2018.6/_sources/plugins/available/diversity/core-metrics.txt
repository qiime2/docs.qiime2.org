     Applies a collection of diversity metrics (non-phylogenetic) to a feature
     table.

   Options:
     --i-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     The feature table containing the samples
                                     over which diversity metrics should be
                                     computed.  [required]
     --p-sampling-depth INTEGER RANGE
                                     The total frequency that each sample should
                                     be rarefied to prior to computing diversity
                                     metrics.  [required]
     --m-metadata-file MULTIPLE PATH
                                     Metadata file or artifact viewable as
                                     metadata. This option may be supplied
                                     multiple times to merge metadata. The sample
                                     metadata to use in the emperor plots.
                                     [required]
     --p-n-jobs INTEGER RANGE        [beta methods only] - The number of jobs to
                                     use for the computation. This works by
                                     breaking down the pairwise matrix into
                                     n_jobs even slices and computing them in
                                     parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is
                                     given, no parallel computing code is used at
                                     all, which is useful for debugging. For
                                     n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are
                                     used. Thus for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but one
                                     are used. (Description from
                                     sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances)

         <pre>Core diversity metrics (non-phylogenetic)

   Applies a collection of diversity metrics (non-phylogenetic) to a feature
   table.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table containing the samples over which diversity metrics
       should be computed.
   sampling_depth : Int % Range(1, None)
       The total frequency that each sample should be rarefied to prior to
       computing diversity metrics.
   metadata : Metadata
       The sample metadata to use in the emperor plots.
   n_jobs : Int % Range(0, None), optional
       [beta methods only] - The number of jobs to use for the computation.
       This works by breaking down the pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices
       and computing them in parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is given,
       no parallel computing code is used at all, which is useful for
       debugging. For n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. Thus
       for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but one are used. (Description from
       sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances)
