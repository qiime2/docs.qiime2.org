     Given a feature table and the associated feature sequences, cluster the
     features based on user-specified percent identity threshold of their
     sequences. This is not a general-purpose de novo clustering method, but
     rather is intended to be used for clustering the results of quality-
     filtering/dereplication methods, such as DADA2, or for re-clustering a
     FeatureTable at a lower percent identity than it was originally clustered
     at. When a group of features in the input table are clustered into a
     single feature, the frequency of that single feature in a given sample is
     the sum of the frequencies of the features that were clustered in that
     sample. Feature identifiers and sequences will be inherited from the
     centroid feature of each cluster. See the vsearch documentation for
     details on how sequence clustering is performed.

   Options:
     --i-sequences ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     The sequences corresponding to the features
                                     in table.  [required]
     --i-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     The feature table to be clustered.
                                     [required]
     --p-perc-identity FLOAT         The percent identity at which clustering
                                     should be performed. This parameter maps to
                                     vsearch's --id parameter.  [required]
     --p-threads INTEGER RANGE       The number of threads to use for
                                     computation. Passing 0 will launch one
                                     thread per CPU core.  [default: 1]
     --o-clustered-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     The table following clustering of features.
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --o-clustered-sequences ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     Sequences representing clustered features.
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]
     --help                          Show this message and exit.</pre>

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences corresponding to the features in table.
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table to be clustered.
   perc_identity : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_start=False, inclusive_end=True)
       The percent identity at which clustering should be performed. This
       parameter maps to vsearch's --id parameter.
   threads : Int % Range(0, 256, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The number of threads to use for computation. Passing 0 will launch one
       thread per CPU core.

   Returns
   -------
   clustered_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The table following clustering of features.
   clustered_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       Sequences representing clustered features.</pre>
