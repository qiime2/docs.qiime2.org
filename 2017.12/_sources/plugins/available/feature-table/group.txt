         <pre>Usage: qiime feature-table group [OPTIONS]

     Group samples or features in a feature table using metadata to define the
     mapping of IDs to a group.

   Options:
     --i-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     The table to group samples or features on.
                                     [required]
     --p-axis [sample|feature]       Along which axis to group. Each ID in the
                                     given axis must exist in `metadata`.
                                     [required]
     --m-metadata-file MULTIPLE PATH
                                     Metadata file or artifact viewable as
                                     metadata. This option may be supplied
                                     multiple times to merge metadata.
                                     [required]
     --m-metadata-category TEXT      Category from metadata file or artifact
                                     viewable as metadata. A category defining
                                     the groups. Each unique value will become a
                                     new ID for the table on the given `axis`.
                                     [required]
     --p-mode [median-ceiling|mean-ceiling|sum]
                                     How to combine samples or features within a
                                     group. `sum` will sum the frequencies across
                                     all samples or features within a group;
                                     `mean-ceiling` will take the ceiling of the
                                     mean of these frequencies; `median-ceiling`
                                     will take the ceiling of the median of these
                                     frequencies.  [required]
     --o-grouped-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     A table that has been grouped along the
                                     given `axis`. IDs on that axis are replaced
                                     by values in the `metadata` category.
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.

         <pre>Group samples or features by a metadata category

   Group samples or features in a feature table using metadata to define the
   mapping of IDs to a group.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The table to group samples or features on.
   axis : Str % Choices({'feature', 'sample'})
       Along which axis to group. Each ID in the given axis must exist in
       `metadata`.
   metadata : MetadataCategory
       A category defining the groups. Each unique value will become a new ID
       for the table on the given `axis`.
   mode : Str % Choices({'mean-ceiling', 'median-ceiling', 'sum'})
       How to combine samples or features within a group. `sum` will sum the
       frequencies across all samples or features within a group; `mean-
       ceiling` will take the ceiling of the mean of these frequencies;
       `median-ceiling` will take the ceiling of the median of these
       frequencies.

   Returns
   -------
   grouped_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       A table that has been grouped along the given `axis`. IDs on that axis
       are replaced by values in the `metadata` category.</pre>
