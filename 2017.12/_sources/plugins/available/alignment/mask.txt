         <pre>Usage: qiime alignment mask [OPTIONS]

     Mask (i.e., filter) unconserved and highly gapped columns from an
     alignment.

   Options:
     --i-alignment ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
                                     The alignment to be masked.  [required]
     --p-max-gap-frequency FLOAT     The maximum relative frequency of gap
                                     characters in a column for the column to be
                                     retained. This relative frequency must be a
                                     number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive),
                                     where 0.0 retains only those columns without
                                     gap characters, and 1.0 retains all columns
                                     regardless of gap character frequency.
                                     [default: 1.0]
     --p-min-conservation FLOAT      The minimum relative frequency of at least
                                     one non-gap character in a column for that
                                     column to be retained. This relative
                                     frequency must be a number between 0.0 and
                                     1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a value of
                                     0.4 is provided, a column will only be
                                     retained if it contains at least one
                                     character that is present in at least 40% of
                                     the sequences.  [default: 0.4]
     --o-masked-alignment ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
                                     The masked alignment.  [required if not
                                     passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]
     --help                          Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Positional conservation and gap filtering.

   Mask (i.e., filter) unconserved and highly gapped columns from an
   alignment.

   Parameters
   ----------
   alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
       The alignment to be masked.
   max_gap_frequency : Float, optional
       The maximum relative frequency of gap characters in a column for the
       column to be retained. This relative frequency must be a number between
       0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive), where 0.0 retains only those columns without
       gap characters, and 1.0 retains all columns regardless of gap character
       frequency.
   min_conservation : Float, optional
       The minimum relative frequency of at least one non-gap character in a
       column for that column to be retained. This relative frequency must be
       a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a value of
       0.4 is provided, a column will only be retained if it contains at least
       one character that is present in at least 40% of the sequences.

   Returns
   -------
   masked_alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
       The masked alignment.</pre>
