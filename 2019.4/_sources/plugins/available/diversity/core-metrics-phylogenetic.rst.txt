         <pre>Usage: qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic [OPTIONS]

     Applies a collection of diversity metrics (both phylogenetic and non-
     phylogenetic) to a feature table.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                             The feature table containing the samples over which
                             diversity metrics should be computed.     [required]
     --i-phylogeny ARTIFACT  Phylogenetic tree containing tip identifiers that
       Phylogeny[Rooted]     correspond to the feature identifiers in the table.
                             This tree can contain tip ids that are not present
                             in the table, but all feature ids in the table must
                             be present in this tree.                  [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-sampling-depth INTEGER
       Range(1, None)        The total frequency that each sample should be
                             rarefied to prior to computing diversity metrics.
                                                                       [required]
     --m-metadata-file METADATA...
       (multiple arguments   The sample metadata to use in the emperor plots.
        will be merged)                                                [required]
     --p-n-jobs INTEGER      [beta/beta-phylogenetic methods only, excluding
       Range(0, None)        weighted_unifrac] - The number of jobs to use for
                             the computation. This works by breaking down the
                             pairwise matrix into n-jobs even slices and
                             computing them in parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used.
                             If 1 is given, no parallel computing code is used at
                             all, which is useful for debugging. For n-jobs below
                             -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n-jobs) are used. Thus for n-jobs
                             = -2, all CPUs but one are used. (Description from
                             sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances)     [default: 1]

         <pre>Core diversity metrics (phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic)

   Applies a collection of diversity metrics (both phylogenetic and non-
   phylogenetic) to a feature table.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table containing the samples over which diversity metrics
       should be computed.
   phylogeny : Phylogeny[Rooted]
       Phylogenetic tree containing tip identifiers that correspond to the
       feature identifiers in the table. This tree can contain tip ids that
       are not present in the table, but all feature ids in the table must be
       present in this tree.
   sampling_depth : Int % Range(1, None)
       The total frequency that each sample should be rarefied to prior to
       computing diversity metrics.
   metadata : Metadata
       The sample metadata to use in the emperor plots.
   n_jobs : Int % Range(0, None), optional
       [beta/beta-phylogenetic methods only, excluding weighted_unifrac] - The
       number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by breaking down
       the pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices and computing them in
       parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is given, no parallel computing
       code is used at all, which is useful for debugging. For n_jobs below
       -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. Thus for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but
       one are used. (Description from sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances)
