         <pre>Usage: qiime feature-table filter-seqs [OPTIONS]

     Filter features from sequences based on a feature table or metadata. See
     the filtering tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.
     This method can filter based on ids in a table or a metadata file, but not
     both (i.e., the table and metadata options are mutually exclusive).

   Inputs:
     --i-data ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                          The sequences from which features should be filtered.
                                                                       [required]
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          Table containing feature ids used for id-based
                          filtering.                                   [optional]
   Parameters:
     --m-metadata-file METADATA...
       (multiple          Feature metadata used for id-based filtering, with
        arguments will    `where` parameter when selecting features to retain, or
        be merged)        with `exclude-ids` when selecting features to discard.
                                                                       [optional]
     --p-where TEXT       SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature metadata
                          criteria that must be met to be included in the
                          filtered feature table. If not provided, all features
                          in `metadata` that are also in the sequences will be
                          retained.                                    [optional]
     --p-exclude-ids / --p-no-exclude-ids
                          If true, the features selected by the `metadata` (with
                          or without the `where` parameter) or `table` parameter
                          will be excluded from the filtered sequences instead of
                          being retained.                        [default: False]
   Outputs:
     --o-filtered-data ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                          The resulting filtered sequences.            [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations          Show citations and exit.
     --help               Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Filter features from sequences

   Filter features from sequences based on a feature table or metadata. See
   the filtering tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.
   This method can filter based on ids in a table or a metadata file, but not
   both (i.e., the table and metadata options are mutually exclusive).

   Parameters
   ----------
   data : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences from which features should be filtered.
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency], optional
       Table containing feature ids used for id-based filtering.
   metadata : Metadata, optional
       Feature metadata used for id-based filtering, with `where` parameter
       when selecting features to retain, or with `exclude_ids` when selecting
       features to discard.
   where : Str, optional
       SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature metadata criteria that must be
       met to be included in the filtered feature table. If not provided, all
       features in `metadata` that are also in the sequences will be retained.
   exclude_ids : Bool, optional
       If true, the features selected by the `metadata` (with or without the
       `where` parameter) or `table` parameter will be excluded from the
       filtered sequences instead of being retained.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_data : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The resulting filtered sequences.</pre>
