         <pre>Usage: qiime feature-table core-features [OPTIONS]

     Identify "core" features, which are features observed in a user-defined
     fraction of the samples. Since the core features are a function of the
     fraction of samples that the feature must be observed in to be considered
     core, this is computed over a range of fractions defined by the
     `min_fraction`, `max_fraction`, and `steps` parameters.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          The feature table to use in core features
                          calculations.                                [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-min-fraction PROPORTION Range(0.0, 1.0, inclusive_start=False)
                          The minimum fraction of samples that a feature must be
                          observed in for that feature to be considered a core
                          feature.                                 [default: 0.5]
     --p-max-fraction PROPORTION Range(0.0, 1.0, inclusive_end=True)
                          The maximum fraction of samples that a feature must be
                          observed in for that feature to be considered a core
                          feature.                                 [default: 1.0]
     --p-steps INTEGER    The number of steps to take between `min-fraction` and
       Range(2, None)     `max-fraction` for core features calculations. This
                          parameter has no effect if `min-fraction` and
                          `max-fraction` are the same value.        [default: 11]
   Outputs:
     --o-visualization VISUALIZATION
                                                                       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations          Show citations and exit.
     --help               Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Identify core features in table

   Identify "core" features, which are features observed in a user-defined
   fraction of the samples. Since the core features are a function of the
   fraction of samples that the feature must be observed in to be considered
   core, this is computed over a range of fractions defined by the
   `min_fraction`, `max_fraction`, and `steps` parameters.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table to use in core features calculations.
   min_fraction : Float % Range(0.0, 1.0, inclusive_start=False), optional
       The minimum fraction of samples that a feature must be observed in for
       that feature to be considered a core feature.
   max_fraction : Float % Range(0.0, 1.0, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The maximum fraction of samples that a feature must be observed in for
       that feature to be considered a core feature.
   steps : Int % Range(2, None), optional
       The number of steps to take between `min_fraction` and `max_fraction`
       for core features calculations. This parameter has no effect if
       `min_fraction` and `max_fraction` are the same value.

   Returns
