         <pre>Usage: qiime longitudinal first-distances [OPTIONS]

     Calculates first distances between sequential states for samples collected
     from individual subjects sampled repeatedly at two or more states. This
     method is similar to the "first differences" method, except that it
     requires a distance matrix as input and calculates first differences as
     distances between successive states. Outputs a data series of first
     distances for each individual subject at each sequential pair of states,
     labeled by the SampleID of the second state (e.g., paired distances
     between time 0 and time 1 would be labeled by the SampleIDs at time 1).
     This file can be used as input to linear mixed effects models or other
     longitudinal or diversity methods to compare changes in first distances
     across time or among groups of subjects. Also supports distance from
     baseline (or other static comparison state) by setting the "baseline"
     parameter.

   Inputs:
     --i-distance-matrix ARTIFACT
       DistanceMatrix       Matrix of distances between pairs of samples.
                                                                       [required]
   Parameters:
     --m-metadata-file METADATA...

     --p-state-column TEXT  Metadata column containing state (time) variable
                            information.                               [required]
     --p-individual-id-column TEXT
                            Metadata column containing IDs for individual
                            subjects.                                  [required]
     --p-baseline NUMBER    A value listed in the state-column metadata column
                            against which all other states should be compared.
                            Toggles calculation of static distances instead of
                            first distances (which are calculated if no value is
                            given for baseline). If a "baseline" value is
                            provided, sample distances at each state are compared
                            against the baseline state, instead of the previous
                            state. Must be a value listed in the state-column.
                                                                       [optional]
     --p-replicate-handling TEXT Choices('error', 'random', 'drop')
                            Choose how replicate samples are handled. If
                            replicates are detected, "error" causes method to
                            fail; "drop" will discard all replicated samples;
                            "random" chooses one representative at random from
                            among replicates.                  [default: 'error']
   Outputs:
     --o-first-distances ARTIFACT SampleData[FirstDifferences]
                            Series of first distances.                 [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH      Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                            during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                            execution is successful (silence is golden).

         <pre>Compute first distances or distance from baseline between sequential states

   Calculates first distances between sequential states for samples collected
   from individual subjects sampled repeatedly at two or more states. This
   method is similar to the "first differences" method, except that it
   requires a distance matrix as input and calculates first differences as
   distances between successive states. Outputs a data series of first
   distances for each individual subject at each sequential pair of states,
   labeled by the SampleID of the second state (e.g., paired distances between
   time 0 and time 1 would be labeled by the SampleIDs at time 1). This file
   can be used as input to linear mixed effects models or other longitudinal
   or diversity methods to compare changes in first distances across time or
   among groups of subjects. Also supports distance from baseline (or other
   static comparison state) by setting the "baseline" parameter.

   Parameters
   ----------
   distance_matrix : DistanceMatrix
       Matrix of distances between pairs of samples.
   metadata : Metadata
       Sample metadata file containing individual_id_column.
   state_column : Str
       Metadata column containing state (time) variable information.
   individual_id_column : Str
       Metadata column containing IDs for individual subjects.
   baseline : Float, optional
       A value listed in the state_column metadata column against which all
       other states should be compared. Toggles calculation of static
       distances instead of first distances (which are calculated if no value
       is given for baseline). If a "baseline" value is provided, sample
       distances at each state are compared against the baseline state,
       instead of the previous state. Must be a value listed in the
       state_column.
   replicate_handling : Str % Choices('error', 'random', 'drop'), optional
       Choose how replicate samples are handled. If replicates are detected,
       "error" causes method to fail; "drop" will discard all replicated
       samples; "random" chooses one representative at random from among
       replicates.

   Returns
   -------
   first_distances : SampleData[FirstDifferences]
       Series of first distances.</pre>
