         <pre>Usage: qiime vsearch dereplicate-sequences [OPTIONS]

     Dereplicate sequence data and create a feature table and feature
     representative sequences. Feature identifiers in the resulting artifacts
     will be the sha1 hash of the sequence defining each feature. If clustering
     of features into OTUs is desired, the resulting artifacts can be passed to
     the cluster_features_* methods in this plugin.

   Inputs:
     --i-sequences ARTIFACT SampleData[Sequences] |
       SampleData[SequencesWithQuality] | SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
                             The sequences to be dereplicated.         [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-derep-prefix / --p-no-derep-prefix
                             Merge sequences with identical prefixes. If a
                             sequence is identical to the prefix of two or more
                             longer sequences, it is clustered with the shortest
                             of them. If they are equally long, it is clustered
                             with the most abundant.             [default: False]
   Outputs:
     --o-dereplicated-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                             The table of dereplicated sequences.      [required]
     --o-dereplicated-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             The dereplicated sequences.               [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                             during execution of this action. Or silence output
                             if execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations             Show citations and exit.
     --help                  Show this message and exit.</pre>

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : SampleData[Sequences] | SampleData[SequencesWithQuality] | SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
       The sequences to be dereplicated.
   derep_prefix : Bool, optional
       Merge sequences with identical prefixes. If a sequence is identical to
       the prefix of two or more longer sequences, it is clustered with the
       shortest of them. If they are equally long, it is clustered with the
       most abundant.

   Returns
   -------
   dereplicated_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The table of dereplicated sequences.
   dereplicated_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The dereplicated sequences.</pre>
