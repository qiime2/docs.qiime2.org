     Perform sequence quality control for Illumina data using the Deblur
     workflow, including positive alignment-based filtering. Only forward reads
     are supported at this time. This mode of execution is particularly useful
     when operating on non-16S data. For example, to apply Deblur to 18S data,
     you would want to specify a reference composed of 18S sequences in order
     to filter out sequences which do not appear to be 18S. The assessment is
     performed by local alignment using SortMeRNA with a permissive e-value
     threshold.

   Inputs:
     --i-demultiplexed-seqs ARTIFACT SampleData[SequencesWithQuality |
       PairedEndSequencesWithQuality | JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
                            The demultiplexed sequences to be denoised.

                            Positive filtering database. Keep all sequences
                            aligning to these sequences.               [required]
   Parameters:

     --p-sample-stats / --p-no-sample-stats

                            sequence estimate.                   [default: 0.005]
     --p-indel-prob NUMBER  Insertion/deletion (indel) probability (same for N
                            indels).                              [default: 0.01]
     --p-indel-max INTEGER  Maximum number of insertion/deletions.   [default: 3]
     --p-min-reads INTEGER  Retain only features appearing at least min-reads
                            times across all samples in the resulting feature
                            table.                                  [default: 10]
     --p-min-size INTEGER   In each sample, discard all features with an
                            abundance less than min-size.            [default: 2]
     --p-jobs-to-start INTEGER
                            Number of jobs to start (if to run in parallel).
                                                                     [default: 1]
     --p-hashed-feature-ids / --p-no-hashed-feature-ids
                            If true, hash the feature IDs.        [default: True]
   Outputs:
     --o-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                            The resulting denoised feature table.      [required]
     --o-representative-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                            The resulting feature sequences.           [required]
     --o-stats ARTIFACT     Per-sample stats if requested.
       DeblurStats                                                     [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH      Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                            during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                            execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations            Show citations and exit.
