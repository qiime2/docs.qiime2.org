     Perform sequence quality control for Illumina data using the Deblur
     workflow, including positive alignment-based filtering. Only forward reads
     are supported at this time. This mode of execution is particularly useful
     when operating on non-16S data. For example, to apply Deblur to 18S data,
     you would want to specify a reference composed of 18S sequences in order
     to filter out sequences which do not appear to be 18S. The assessment is
     performed by local alignment using SortMeRNA with a permissive e-value
     threshold.
