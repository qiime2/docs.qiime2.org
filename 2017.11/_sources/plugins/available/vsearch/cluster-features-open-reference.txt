     Given a feature table and the associated feature sequences, cluster the
     features against a reference database based on user-specified percent
     identity threshold of their sequences. Any sequences that don't match are
     then clustered de novo. This is not a general-purpose clustering method,
     but rather is intended to be used for clustering the results of quality-
     filtering/dereplication methods, such as DADA2, or for re-clustering a
     FeatureTable at a lower percent identity than it was originally clustered
     at. When a group of features in the input table are clustered into a
     single feature, the frequency of that single feature in a given sample is
     the sum of the frequencies of the features that were clustered in that
     sample. Feature identifiers will be inherited from the centroid feature of
     each cluster. For features that match a reference sequence, the centroid
     feature is that reference sequence, so its identifier will become the
     feature identifier. The clustered_sequences result will contain feature
     representative sequences that are derived from the sequences input for all
     features in clustered_table. This will always be the most abundant
     sequence in the cluster. The new_reference_sequences result will contain
     the entire reference database, plus feature representative sequences for
     any de novo features. This is intended to be used as a reference database
     in subsequent iterations of cluster_features_open_reference, if
     applicable. See the vsearch documentation for details on how sequence
     clustering is performed.

                                     runs of open-reference clustering for
                                     consistent definitions of features across

         <pre>Open-reference clustering of features.

   Given a feature table and the associated feature sequences, cluster the
   features against a reference database based on user-specified percent
   identity threshold of their sequences. Any sequences that don't match are
   then clustered de novo. This is not a general-purpose clustering method,
   but rather is intended to be used for clustering the results of quality-
   filtering/dereplication methods, such as DADA2, or for re-clustering a
   FeatureTable at a lower percent identity than it was originally clustered
   at. When a group of features in the input table are clustered into a single
   feature, the frequency of that single feature in a given sample is the sum
   of the frequencies of the features that were clustered in that sample.
   Feature identifiers will be inherited from the centroid feature of each
   cluster. For features that match a reference sequence, the centroid feature
   is that reference sequence, so its identifier will become the feature
   identifier. The clustered_sequences result will contain feature
   representative sequences that are derived from the sequences input for all
   features in clustered_table. This will always be the most abundant sequence
   in the cluster. The new_reference_sequences result will contain the entire
   reference database, plus feature representative sequences for any de novo
   features. This is intended to be used as a reference database in subsequent
   iterations of cluster_features_open_reference, if applicable. See the
   vsearch documentation for details on how sequence clustering is performed.
