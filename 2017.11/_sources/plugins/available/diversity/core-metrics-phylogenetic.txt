     Applies a collection of diversity metrics (both phylogenetic and non-
     phylogenetic) to a feature table.

   Options:
     --i-table PATH                  Artifact: FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     [required]
                                     The feature table containing the
                                     samples over which diversity metrics should
                                     be computed.
     --i-phylogeny PATH              Artifact: Phylogeny[Rooted]  [required]
                                     Phylogenetic tree containing tip identifiers
                                     that correspond to the feature identifiers
                                     in the table. This tree can contain tip ids
                                     that are not present in the table, but all
                                     feature ids in the table must be present in
                                     this tree.
     --p-sampling-depth INTEGER RANGE
                                     [required]
                                     The total frequency that each
                                     sample should be rarefied to prior to
                                     computing diversity metrics.
     --m-metadata-file PATH          Metadata file or artifact viewable as
                                     metadata. This option may be supplied
                                     multiple times to merge metadata  [required]
                                     The sample metadata to use in the emperor
                                     plots.
     --p-n-jobs INTEGER RANGE        [default: 1]
                                     [beta/beta-phylogenetic methods
                                     only, excluding weighted_unifrac] - The
                                     number of jobs to use for the computation.
                                     This works by breaking down the pairwise
                                     matrix into n_jobs even slices and computing
                                     them in parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used.
                                     If 1 is given, no parallel computing code is
                                     used at all, which is useful for debugging.
                                     For n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs)
                                     are used. Thus for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but
                                     one are used. (Description from

         <pre>Core diversity metrics (phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic)

   Applies a collection of diversity metrics (both phylogenetic and non-
   phylogenetic) to a feature table.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table containing the samples over which diversity metrics
       should be computed.
   phylogeny : Phylogeny[Rooted]
       Phylogenetic tree containing tip identifiers that correspond to the
       feature identifiers in the table. This tree can contain tip ids that
       are not present in the table, but all feature ids in the table must be
       present in this tree.
   sampling_depth : Int % Range(1, None)
       The total frequency that each sample should be rarefied to prior to
       computing diversity metrics.
   metadata : Metadata
       The sample metadata to use in the emperor plots.
   n_jobs : Int % Range(0, None), optional
       [beta/beta-phylogenetic methods only, excluding weighted_unifrac] - The
       number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by breaking down
       the pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices and computing them in
       parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is given, no parallel computing
       code is used at all, which is useful for debugging. For n_jobs below
       -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. Thus for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but
       one are used. (Description from sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances)
