     Apply a two-sided Mantel test to identify correlation between two distance
     matrices.

     Note: the directionality of the comparison has no bearing on the results.
     Thus, comparing distance matrix X to distance matrix Y is equivalent to
     comparing Y to X.

     Note: the order of samples within the two distance matrices does not need
     to be the same; the distance matrices will be reordered before applying
     the Mantel test.

     See the scikit-bio docs for more details about the Mantel test:

                                     of distances between pairs of samples.
     --i-dm2 PATH                    Artifact: DistanceMatrix  [required]

                                     of distances between pairs of samples.
     --p-method [pearson|spearman]   [default: spearman]
                                     The correlation test to
                                     be applied in the Mantel test.
     --p-permutations INTEGER RANGE  [default: 999]
                                     The number of permutations to
                                     be run when computing p-values. Supplying a
                                     value of zero will disable permutation
                                     testing and p-values will not be calculated
                                     (this results in *much* quicker execution
                                     time if p-values are not desired).

                                     discarded before applying the Mantel test.
                                     Default behavior is to error on any

   Parameters
   ----------
   dm1 : DistanceMatrix
       Matrix of distances between pairs of samples.
   dm2 : DistanceMatrix
       Matrix of distances between pairs of samples.
   method : Str % Choices({'pearson', 'spearman'}), optional
       The correlation test to be applied in the Mantel test.
   permutations : Int % Range(0, None), optional
       The number of permutations to be run when computing p-values. Supplying
       a value of zero will disable permutation testing and p-values will not
       be calculated (this results in *much* quicker execution time if
       p-values are not desired).
   intersect_ids : Bool, optional
       If supplied, IDs that are not found in both distance matrices will be
       discarded before applying the Mantel test. Default behavior is to error
       on any mismatched IDs.
   label1 : Str, optional
       Label for `dm1` in the output visualization.
   label2 : Str, optional
       Label for `dm2` in the output visualization.
