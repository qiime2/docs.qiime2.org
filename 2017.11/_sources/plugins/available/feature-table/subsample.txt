         <pre>Usage: qiime feature-table subsample [OPTIONS]

     Randomly pick samples or features, without replacement, from the table.

   Options:
     --i-table PATH                  Artifact: FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     [required]
                                     The feature table to be sampled.
     --p-subsampling-depth INTEGER RANGE
                                     [required]
                                     The total number of samples or
                                     features to be randomly sampled. Samples or
                                     features that are reduced to a zero sum will
                                     not be included in the resulting table.
     --p-axis [sample|feature]       [required]
                                     The axis to sample over. If
                                     "sample" then samples will be randomly
                                     selected to be retained. If "feature" then a
                                     random set of features will be selected to
                                     be retained.
     --o-sampled-table PATH          Artifact: FeatureTable[Frequency] [required
                                     if not passing --output-dir]
                                     The resulting
                                     subsampled feature table.
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]
     --help                          Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Subsample table

   Randomly pick samples or features, without replacement, from the table.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table to be sampled.
   subsampling_depth : Int % Range(1, None)
       The total number of samples or features to be randomly sampled. Samples
       or features that are reduced to a zero sum will not be included in the
       resulting table.
   axis : Str % Choices({'feature', 'sample'})
       The axis to sample over. If "sample" then samples will be randomly
       selected to be retained. If "feature" then a random set of features
       will be selected to be retained.

   Returns
   -------
   sampled_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The resulting subsampled feature table.</pre>
