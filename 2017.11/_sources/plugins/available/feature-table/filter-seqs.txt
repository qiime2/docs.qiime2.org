         <pre>Usage: qiime feature-table filter-seqs [OPTIONS]

     Filter features from sequences based on ids or metadata. See the filtering
     tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.

   Options:
     --i-data PATH                   Artifact: FeatureData[Sequence]  [required]
                                     The sequences from which features should be
                                     filtered.
     --m-metadata-file PATH          Metadata file or artifact viewable as
                                     metadata. This option may be supplied
                                     multiple times to merge metadata  [required]
                                     Feature metadata used for id-based
                                     filtering, with `where` parameter when
                                     selecting features to retain, or with
                                     `exclude_ids` when selecting features to
                                     discard.
     --p-where TEXT                  [optional]
                                     SQLite WHERE clause specifying
                                     feature metadata criteria that must be met
                                     to be included in the filtered feature
                                     table. If not provided, all features in
                                     `metadata` that are also in the sequences
                                     will be retained.
     --p-exclude-ids / --p-no-exclude-ids
                                     [default: False]
                                     If true, the features
                                     selected by `metadata` or `where` parameters
                                     will be excluded from the filtered sequences
                                     instead of being retained.
     --o-filtered-data PATH          Artifact: FeatureData[Sequence] [required if
                                     not passing --output-dir]
                                     The resulting
                                     filtered sequences.
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.

         <pre>Filter features from sequences

   Filter features from sequences based on ids or metadata. See the filtering
   tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.

   Parameters
   ----------
   data : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences from which features should be filtered.
   metadata : Metadata
       Feature metadata used for id-based filtering, with `where` parameter
       when selecting features to retain, or with `exclude_ids` when selecting
       features to discard.
   where : Str, optional
       SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature metadata criteria that must be
       met to be included in the filtered feature table. If not provided, all
       features in `metadata` that are also in the sequences will be retained.
   exclude_ids : Bool, optional
       If true, the features selected by `metadata` or `where` parameters will
       be excluded from the filtered sequences instead of being retained.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_data : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The resulting filtered sequences.</pre>
