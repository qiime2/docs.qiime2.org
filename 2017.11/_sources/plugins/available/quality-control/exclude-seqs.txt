     This method aligns feature sequences to a set of reference sequences to
     identify sequences that hit/miss the reference within a specified
     perc_identity, evalue, and perc_query_aligned. This method could be used
     to define a positive filter, e.g., extract only feature sequences that
     align to a certain clade of bacteria; or to define a negative filter,
     e.g., identify sequences that align to contaminant or human DNA sequences
     that should be excluded from subsequent analyses. Note that filtering is
     performed based on the perc_identity, perc_query_aligned, and evalue
     thresholds (the latter only if method==BLAST and an evalue is set). Set
     perc_identity==0 and/or perc_query_aligned==0 to disable these filtering
     thresholds as necessary.

   evalue : Float, optional
       BLAST expectation (E) value threshold for saving hits. Reject if E
