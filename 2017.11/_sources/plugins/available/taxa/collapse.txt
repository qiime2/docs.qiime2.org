         <pre>Usage: qiime taxa collapse [OPTIONS]

     Collapse groups of features that have the same taxonomic assignment
     through the specified level. The frequencies of all features will be
     summed when they are collapsed.

   Options:
     --i-table PATH            Artifact: FeatureTable[Frequency]  [required]
                               Feature table to be collapsed.
     --i-taxonomy PATH         Artifact: FeatureData[Taxonomy]  [required]
                               Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided
                               feature table. All features in the feature table
                               must have a corresponding taxonomic annotation.
                               Taxonomic annotations that are not present in the
                               feature table will be ignored.
     --p-level INTEGER         [required]
                               The taxonomic level at which the
                               features should be collapsed. All ouput features
                               will have exactly this many levels of taxonomic
                               annotation.
     --o-collapsed-table PATH  Artifact: FeatureTable[Frequency] [required if not
                               passing --output-dir]
                               The resulting feature table,
                               where all features are now taxonomic annotations
                               with the user-specified number of levels.
     --output-dir DIRECTORY    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH         Use config file for command options
     --verbose                 Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                               during execution of this action.  [default: False]
     --quiet                   Silence output if execution is successful (silence
                               is golden).  [default: False]
     --help                    Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Collapse features by their taxonomy at the specified level

   Collapse groups of features that have the same taxonomic assignment through
   the specified level. The frequencies of all features will be summed when
   they are collapsed.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       Feature table to be collapsed.
   taxonomy : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided feature table. All
       features in the feature table must have a corresponding taxonomic
       annotation. Taxonomic annotations that are not present in the feature
       table will be ignored.
   level : Int
       The taxonomic level at which the features should be collapsed. All
       ouput features will have exactly this many levels of taxonomic
       annotation.

   Returns
   -------
   collapsed_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The resulting feature table, where all features are now taxonomic
       annotations with the user-specified number of levels.</pre>
