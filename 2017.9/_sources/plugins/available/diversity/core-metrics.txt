                                     [required]
                                     The feature table containing the
                                     samples over which diversity metrics should
                                     be computed.
     --p-sampling-depth INTEGER      [required]
                                     The total frequency that each
                                     sample should be rarefied to prior to
                                     computing diversity metrics.
     --p-n-jobs INTEGER              [default: 1]
                                     [beta methods only] - The
                                     number of jobs to use for the computation.
                                     This works by breaking down the pairwise
                                     matrix into n_jobs even slices and computing
                                     them in parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used.
                                     If 1 is given, no parallel computing code is
                                     used at all, which is useful for debugging.
                                     For n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs)
                                     are used. Thus for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but
                                     one are used. (Description from

         <pre>Core diversity metrics (non-phylogenetic)

   Applies a collection of diversity metrics (non-phylogenetic) to a feature
   table.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table containing the samples over which diversity metrics
       should be computed.
   sampling_depth : Int
       The total frequency that each sample should be rarefied to prior to
       computing diversity metrics.
   n_jobs : Int, optional
       [beta methods only] - The number of jobs to use for the computation.
       This works by breaking down the pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices
       and computing them in parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is given,
       no parallel computing code is used at all, which is useful for
       debugging. For n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. Thus
       for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but one are used. (Description from
       sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances)
