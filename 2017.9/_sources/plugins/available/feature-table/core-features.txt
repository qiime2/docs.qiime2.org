         <pre>Usage: qiime feature-table core-features [OPTIONS]

     Identify "core" features, which are features observed in a user-defined
     fraction of the samples. Since the core features are a function of the
     fraction of samples that the feature must be observed in to be considered
     core, this is computed over a range of fractions defined by the
     `min_fraction`, `max_fraction`, and `steps` parameters.

   Options:
     --i-table PATH           Artifact: FeatureTable[Frequency]  [required]
                              The
                              feature table to use in core features calculations.
     --p-min-fraction FLOAT   [default: 0.5]
                              The minimum fraction of samples that
                              a feature must be observed in for that feature to
                              be considered a core feature.
     --p-max-fraction FLOAT   [default: 1.0]
                              The maximum fraction of samples that
                              a feature must be observed in for that feature to
                              be considered a core feature.
     --p-steps INTEGER RANGE  [default: 11]
                              The number of steps to take between
                              `min_fraction` and `max_fraction` for core features
                              calculations. This parameter has no effect if
                              `min_fraction` and `max_fraction` are the same
                              value.
     --o-visualization PATH   Visualization [required if not passing --output-
                              dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY   Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH        Use config file for command options
     --verbose                Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                              during execution of this action.  [default: False]
     --quiet                  Silence output if execution is successful (silence
                              is golden).  [default: False]
     --help                   Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Identify core features in table

   Identify "core" features, which are features observed in a user-defined
   fraction of the samples. Since the core features are a function of the
   fraction of samples that the feature must be observed in to be considered
   core, this is computed over a range of fractions defined by the
   `min_fraction`, `max_fraction`, and `steps` parameters.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table to use in core features calculations.
   min_fraction : Float % Range(0.0, 1.0, inclusive_start=False), optional
       The minimum fraction of samples that a feature must be observed in for
       that feature to be considered a core feature.
   max_fraction : Float % Range(0.0, 1.0, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The maximum fraction of samples that a feature must be observed in for
       that feature to be considered a core feature.
   steps : Int % Range(2), optional
       The number of steps to take between `min_fraction` and `max_fraction`
       for core features calculations. This parameter has no effect if
       `min_fraction` and `max_fraction` are the same value.

   Returns
