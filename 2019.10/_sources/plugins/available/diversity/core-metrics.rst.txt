         <pre>Usage: qiime diversity core-metrics [OPTIONS]

     Applies a collection of diversity metrics (non-phylogenetic) to a feature
     table.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          The feature table containing the samples over which
                          diversity metrics should be computed.        [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-sampling-depth INTEGER
       Range(1, None)     The total frequency that each sample should be
                          rarefied to prior to computing diversity metrics.
                                                                       [required]
     --m-metadata-file METADATA...
       (multiple          The sample metadata to use in the emperor plots.
        arguments will    
        be merged)                                                     [required]
     --p-with-replacement / --p-no-with-replacement
                          Rarefy with replacement by sampling from the
                          multinomial distribution instead of rarefying without
                          replacement.                           [default: False]
     --p-n-jobs INTEGER   [beta methods only] - The number of jobs to use for
       Range(0, None)     the computation. This works by breaking down the
                          pairwise matrix into n-jobs even slices and computing
                          them in parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is
                          given, no parallel computing code is used at all, which
                          is useful for debugging. For n-jobs below -1, (n_cpus +
                          1 + n-jobs) are used. Thus for n-jobs = -2, all CPUs
                          but one are used. (Description from
                          sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances)        [default: 1]

         <pre>Core diversity metrics (non-phylogenetic)

   Applies a collection of diversity metrics (non-phylogenetic) to a feature
   table.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table containing the samples over which diversity metrics
       should be computed.
   sampling_depth : Int % Range(1, None)
       The total frequency that each sample should be rarefied to prior to
       computing diversity metrics.
   metadata : Metadata
       The sample metadata to use in the emperor plots.
   with_replacement : Bool, optional
       Rarefy with replacement by sampling from the multinomial distribution
       instead of rarefying without replacement.
   n_jobs : Int % Range(0, None), optional
       [beta methods only] - The number of jobs to use for the computation.
       This works by breaking down the pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices
       and computing them in parallel. If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is given,
       no parallel computing code is used at all, which is useful for
       debugging. For n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. Thus
       for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but one are used. (Description from
       sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances)
