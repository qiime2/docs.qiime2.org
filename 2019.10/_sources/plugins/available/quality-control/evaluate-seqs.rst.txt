         <pre>Usage: qiime quality-control evaluate-seqs [OPTIONS]

     This action aligns a set of query (e.g., observed) sequences against a set
     of reference (e.g., expected) sequences to evaluate the quality of
     alignment. The intended use is to align observed sequences against
     expected sequences (e.g., from a mock community) to determine the
     frequency of mismatches between observed sequences and the most similar
     expected sequences, e.g., as a measure of sequencing/method error.
     However, any sequences may be provided as input to generate a report on
     pairwise alignment quality against a set of reference sequences.

   Inputs:
     --i-query-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                          Sequences to test for exclusion              [required]
     --i-reference-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                          Reference sequences to align against feature sequences
                                                                       [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-show-alignments / --p-no-show-alignments
                          Option to plot pairwise alignments of query sequences
                          and their top hits.                    [default: False]
   Outputs:
     --o-visualization VISUALIZATION
                                                                       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations          Show citations and exit.
     --help               Show this message and exit.</pre>

       Option to plot pairwise alignments of query sequences and their top
       hits.
