         <pre>Usage: qiime longitudinal first-differences [OPTIONS]

     Calculates first differences in "metric" between sequential states for
     samples collected from individual subjects sampled repeatedly at two or
     more states. First differences can be performed on a metadata column
     (including artifacts that can be input as metadata) or a feature in a
     feature table. Outputs a data series of first differences for each
     individual subject at each sequential pair of states, labeled by the
     SampleID of the second state (e.g., paired differences between time 0 and
     time 1 would be labeled by the SampleIDs at time 1). This file can be used
     as input to linear mixed effects models or other longitudinal or diversity
     methods to compare changes in first differences across time or among
     groups of subjects. Also supports differences from baseline (or other
     static comparison state) by setting the "baseline" parameter.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[RelativeFrequency]
                            Feature table to optionally use for computing first
                            differences.                               [optional]
   Parameters:
     --m-metadata-file METADATA...
       (multiple            Sample metadata file containing
        arguments will be   individual-id-column.
        merged)                                                        [required]
     --p-state-column TEXT  Metadata column containing state (time) variable
                            information.                               [required]
     --p-individual-id-column TEXT
                            Metadata column containing IDs for individual
                            subjects.                                  [required]
     --p-metric TEXT        Numerical metadata or artifact column to test.
                                                                       [required]
     --p-replicate-handling TEXT Choices('error', 'random', 'drop')
                            Choose how replicate samples are handled. If
                            replicates are detected, "error" causes method to
                            fail; "drop" will discard all replicated samples;
                            "random" chooses one representative at random from
                            among replicates.                  [default: 'error']
     --p-baseline NUMBER    A value listed in the state-column metadata column
                            against which all other states should be compared.
                            Toggles calculation of static differences instead of
                            first differences (which are calculated if no value
                            is given for baseline). If a "baseline" value is
                            provided, sample differences at each state are
                            compared against the baseline state, instead of the
                            previous state. Must be a value listed in the
                            state-column.                              [optional]
   Outputs:
     --o-first-differences ARTIFACT SampleData[FirstDifferences]
                            Series of first differences.               [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH      Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                            during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                            execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations            Show citations and exit.
     --help                 Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Compute first differences or difference from baseline between sequential
   states

   Calculates first differences in "metric" between sequential states for
   samples collected from individual subjects sampled repeatedly at two or
   more states. First differences can be performed on a metadata column
   (including artifacts that can be input as metadata) or a feature in a
   feature table. Outputs a data series of first differences for each
   individual subject at each sequential pair of states, labeled by the
   SampleID of the second state (e.g., paired differences between time 0 and
   time 1 would be labeled by the SampleIDs at time 1). This file can be used
   as input to linear mixed effects models or other longitudinal or diversity
   methods to compare changes in first differences across time or among groups
   of subjects. Also supports differences from baseline (or other static
   comparison state) by setting the "baseline" parameter.

   Parameters
   ----------
   metadata : Metadata
       Sample metadata file containing individual_id_column.
   state_column : Str
       Metadata column containing state (time) variable information.
   individual_id_column : Str
       Metadata column containing IDs for individual subjects.
   metric : Str
       Numerical metadata or artifact column to test.
   replicate_handling : Str % Choices('error', 'random', 'drop'), optional
       Choose how replicate samples are handled. If replicates are detected,
       "error" causes method to fail; "drop" will discard all replicated
       samples; "random" chooses one representative at random from among
       replicates.
   baseline : Float, optional
       A value listed in the state_column metadata column against which all
       other states should be compared. Toggles calculation of static
       differences instead of first differences (which are calculated if no
       value is given for baseline). If a "baseline" value is provided, sample
       differences at each state are compared against the baseline state,
       instead of the previous state. Must be a value listed in the
       state_column.
   table : FeatureTable[RelativeFrequency], optional
       Feature table to optionally use for computing first differences.

   Returns
   -------
   first_differences : SampleData[FirstDifferences]
       Series of first differences.</pre>
