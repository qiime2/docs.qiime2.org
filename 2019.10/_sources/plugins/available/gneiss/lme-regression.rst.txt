     Build and run linear mixed effects model on balances. Use LME over OLS
     when you have repeated measurements such as (timeseries).

     WARNING:

     This command is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of this
     plugin.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Balance]
                          The feature table containing the samples in which
                          simplicial regression with mixed effect will be
                          performed.                                   [required]
     --i-tree ARTIFACT    A hierarchy of feature identifiers where each tip
       Hierarchy          corresponds to the feature identifiers in the table.
                          This tree can contain tip ids that are not present in
                          the table, but all feature ids in the table must be
                          present in this tree.                        [required]
   Parameters:
     --m-metadata-file METADATA...

        be merged)                                                     [required]
     --p-formula TEXT     Statistical formula specifying the statistical model.
                          In other words, a list of the metadata categories that
                          will be used in the linear mixed effect model,
                          typically separated by "+". For more information see

                          execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations          Show citations and exit.

   Build and run linear mixed effects model on balances. Use LME over OLS when
   you have repeated measurements such as (timeseries).

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Balance]
       The feature table containing the samples in which simplicial regression
       with mixed effect will be performed.
   tree : Hierarchy
       A hierarchy of feature identifiers where each tip corresponds to the
       feature identifiers in the table. This tree can contain tip ids that
       are not present in the table, but all feature ids in the table must be
       present in this tree.
   metadata : Metadata
       Metadata information that contains the covariates of interest.
   formula : Str
       Statistical formula specifying the statistical model. In other words, a
       list of the metadata categories that will be used in the linear mixed
       effect model, typically separated by "+". For more information see
       https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API-reference.html
   groups : Str

   Returns
