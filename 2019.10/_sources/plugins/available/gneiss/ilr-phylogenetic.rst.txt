         <pre>Usage: qiime gneiss ilr-phylogenetic [OPTIONS]

     Calculate balances given a rooted phylogeny.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency | Composition]
                             The feature table containing the samples in which
                             the ilr transform will be performed.      [required]
     --i-tree ARTIFACT       A rooted phylogeny of feature identifiers that
       Phylogeny[Rooted]     defines the partitions of features.  Each tip in the
                             hierarchycorresponds to the feature identifiers in
                             the table. This tree can contain tip ids that are
                             not present in the table, but all feature ids in the
                             table must be present in this tree.  This assumes
                             that all of the internal nodes in the tree have
                             labels. This tree may contain polytomic nodes (i.e.,
                             nodes with more than two children), in which case
                             they will be bifurcated.                  [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-pseudocount NUMBER  The value to add to zero counts in the feature
                             table.                                [default: 0.5]
   Outputs:
     --o-balances ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Balance]
                             The resulting balances from the ilr transform.
                                                                       [required]
     --o-hierarchy ARTIFACT  Hierarchy from bifurcated phylogeny
       Hierarchy                                                       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                             during execution of this action. Or silence output
                             if execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations             Show citations and exit.
     --help                  Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Isometric Log-ratio Transform applied to a phylogenetic tree

   Calculate balances given a rooted phylogeny.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency | Composition]
       The feature table containing the samples in which the ilr transform
       will be performed.
   tree : Phylogeny[Rooted]
       A rooted phylogeny of feature identifiers that defines the partitions
       of features.  Each tip in the hierarchycorresponds to the feature
       identifiers in the table. This tree can contain tip ids that are not
       present in the table, but all feature ids in the table must be present
       in this tree.  This assumes that all of the internal nodes in the tree
       have labels. This tree may contain polytomic nodes (i.e., nodes with
       more than two children), in which case they will be bifurcated.
   pseudocount : Float, optional
       The value to add to zero counts in the feature table.

   Returns
   -------
   balances : FeatureTable[Balance]
       The resulting balances from the ilr transform.
   hierarchy : Hierarchy
       Hierarchy from bifurcated phylogeny</pre>
