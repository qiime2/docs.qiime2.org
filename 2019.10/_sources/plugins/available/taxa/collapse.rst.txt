         <pre>Usage: qiime taxa collapse [OPTIONS]

     Collapse groups of features that have the same taxonomic assignment
     through the specified level. The frequencies of all features will be
     summed when they are collapsed.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                            Feature table to be collapsed.             [required]
     --i-taxonomy ARTIFACT FeatureData[Taxonomy]
                            Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided
                            feature table. All features in the feature table must
                            have a corresponding taxonomic annotation. Taxonomic
                            annotations that are not present in the feature table
                            will be ignored.                           [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-level INTEGER      The taxonomic level at which the features should be
                            collapsed. All ouput features will have exactly this
                            many levels of taxonomic annotation.       [required]
   Outputs:
     --o-collapsed-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                            The resulting feature table, where all features are
                            now taxonomic annotations with the user-specified
                            number of levels.                          [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH      Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                            during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                            execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations            Show citations and exit.
     --help                 Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Collapse features by their taxonomy at the specified level

   Collapse groups of features that have the same taxonomic assignment through
   the specified level. The frequencies of all features will be summed when
   they are collapsed.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       Feature table to be collapsed.
   taxonomy : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided feature table. All
       features in the feature table must have a corresponding taxonomic
       annotation. Taxonomic annotations that are not present in the feature
       table will be ignored.
   level : Int
       The taxonomic level at which the features should be collapsed. All
       ouput features will have exactly this many levels of taxonomic
       annotation.

   Returns
   -------
   collapsed_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The resulting feature table, where all features are now taxonomic
       annotations with the user-specified number of levels.</pre>
