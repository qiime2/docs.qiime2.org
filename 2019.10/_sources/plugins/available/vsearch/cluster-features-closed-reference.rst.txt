     Given a feature table and the associated feature sequences, cluster the
     features against a reference database based on user-specified percent
     identity threshold of their sequences. This is not a general-purpose
     closed-reference clustering method, but rather is intended to be used for
     clustering the results of quality-filtering/dereplication methods, such as
     DADA2, or for re-clustering a FeatureTable at a lower percent identity
     than it was originally clustered at. When a group of features in the input
     table are clustered into a single feature, the frequency of that single
     feature in a given sample is the sum of the frequencies of the features
     that were clustered in that sample. Feature identifiers will be inherited
     from the centroid feature of each cluster. See the vsearch documentation
     for details on how sequence clustering is performed.

   Inputs:
     --i-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             The sequences corresponding to the features in
                             table.                                    [required]
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                             The feature table to be clustered.        [required]
     --i-reference-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             The sequences to use as cluster centroids.
                                                                       [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-perc-identity PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_start=False,
       inclusive_end=True)   The percent identity at which clustering should be
                             performed. This parameter maps to vsearch's --id
                             parameter.                                [required]
     --p-strand TEXT Choices('plus', 'both')
                             Search plus (i.e., forward) or both (i.e., forward
                             and reverse complement) strands.   [default: 'plus']
     --p-threads INTEGER Range(0, 256, inclusive_end=True)
                             The number of threads to use for computation.
                             Passing 0 will launch one thread per CPU core.
                                                                     [default: 1]
   Outputs:
     --o-clustered-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                             The table following clustering of features.
                                                                       [required]
     --o-clustered-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             The sequences representing clustered features,
                             relabeled by the reference IDs.           [required]
     --o-unmatched-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             The sequences which failed to match any reference
                             sequences. This output maps to vsearch's
                             --notmatched parameter.                   [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                             during execution of this action. Or silence output
                             if execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations             Show citations and exit.
     --help                  Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Closed-reference clustering of features.

   Given a feature table and the associated feature sequences, cluster the
   features against a reference database based on user-specified percent
   identity threshold of their sequences. This is not a general-purpose
   closed-reference clustering method, but rather is intended to be used for
   clustering the results of quality-filtering/dereplication methods, such as
   DADA2, or for re-clustering a FeatureTable at a lower percent identity than
   it was originally clustered at. When a group of features in the input table
   are clustered into a single feature, the frequency of that single feature
   in a given sample is the sum of the frequencies of the features that were
   clustered in that sample. Feature identifiers will be inherited from the
   centroid feature of each cluster. See the vsearch documentation for details
   on how sequence clustering is performed.

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences corresponding to the features in table.
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table to be clustered.
   reference_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences to use as cluster centroids.
   perc_identity : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_start=False, inclusive_end=True)
       The percent identity at which clustering should be performed. This
       parameter maps to vsearch's --id parameter.
   strand : Str % Choices('plus', 'both'), optional
       Search plus (i.e., forward) or both (i.e., forward and reverse
       complement) strands.
   threads : Int % Range(0, 256, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The number of threads to use for computation. Passing 0 will launch one
       thread per CPU core.

   Returns
   -------
   clustered_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The table following clustering of features.
   clustered_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences representing clustered features, relabeled by the
       reference IDs.
   unmatched_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences which failed to match any reference sequences. This
       output maps to vsearch's --notmatched parameter.</pre>
