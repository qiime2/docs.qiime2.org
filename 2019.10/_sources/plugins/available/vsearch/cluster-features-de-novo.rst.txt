         <pre>Usage: qiime vsearch cluster-features-de-novo [OPTIONS]

     Given a feature table and the associated feature sequences, cluster the
     features based on user-specified percent identity threshold of their
     sequences. This is not a general-purpose de novo clustering method, but
     rather is intended to be used for clustering the results of quality-
     filtering/dereplication methods, such as DADA2, or for re-clustering a
     FeatureTable at a lower percent identity than it was originally clustered
     at. When a group of features in the input table are clustered into a
     single feature, the frequency of that single feature in a given sample is
     the sum of the frequencies of the features that were clustered in that
     sample. Feature identifiers and sequences will be inherited from the
     centroid feature of each cluster. See the vsearch documentation for
     details on how sequence clustering is performed.

   Inputs:
     --i-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             The sequences corresponding to the features in
                             table.                                    [required]
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                             The feature table to be clustered.        [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-perc-identity PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_start=False,
       inclusive_end=True)   The percent identity at which clustering should be
                             performed. This parameter maps to vsearch's --id
                             parameter.                                [required]
     --p-threads INTEGER Range(0, 256, inclusive_end=True)
                             The number of threads to use for computation.
                             Passing 0 will launch one thread per CPU core.
                                                                     [default: 1]
   Outputs:
     --o-clustered-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                             The table following clustering of features.
                                                                       [required]
     --o-clustered-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             Sequences representing clustered features.
                                                                       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                             during execution of this action. Or silence output
                             if execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations             Show citations and exit.
     --help                  Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>De novo clustering of features.

   Given a feature table and the associated feature sequences, cluster the
   features based on user-specified percent identity threshold of their
   sequences. This is not a general-purpose de novo clustering method, but
   rather is intended to be used for clustering the results of quality-
   filtering/dereplication methods, such as DADA2, or for re-clustering a

   at. When a group of features in the input table are clustered into a single
   feature, the frequency of that single feature in a given sample is the sum
   of the frequencies of the features that were clustered in that sample.
   Feature identifiers and sequences will be inherited from the centroid
   feature of each cluster. See the vsearch documentation for details on how
   sequence clustering is performed.

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences corresponding to the features in table.
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table to be clustered.
   perc_identity : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_start=False, inclusive_end=True)
       The percent identity at which clustering should be performed. This
       parameter maps to vsearch's --id parameter.
   threads : Int % Range(0, 256, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The number of threads to use for computation. Passing 0 will launch one
       thread per CPU core.

   Returns
   -------
   clustered_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The table following clustering of features.
   clustered_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       Sequences representing clustered features.</pre>
