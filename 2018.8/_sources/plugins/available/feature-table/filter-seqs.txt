     Filter features from sequences based on a feature table or metadata. See
     the filtering tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.
     This method can filter based on ids in a table or a metadata file, but not
     both (i.e., the table and metadata options are mutually exclusive).

   Options:
     --i-data ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     The sequences from which features should be
                                     filtered.  [required]
     --i-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     Table containing feature ids used for id-
                                     based filtering.  [optional]
     --m-metadata-file MULTIPLE PATH
                                     Metadata file or artifact viewable as
                                     metadata. This option may be supplied
                                     multiple times to merge metadata. Feature
                                     metadata used for id-based filtering, with
                                     `where` parameter when selecting features to
                                     retain, or with `exclude_ids` when selecting
                                     features to discard.  [optional]
     --p-where TEXT                  SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature
                                     metadata criteria that must be met to be
                                     included in the filtered feature table. If
                                     not provided, all features in `metadata`
                                     that are also in the sequences will be
                                     retained.  [optional]
     --p-exclude-ids / --p-no-exclude-ids
                                     If true, the features selected by the
                                     `metadata` (with or without the `where`
                                     parameter) or `table` parameter will be
                                     excluded from the filtered sequences instead
                                     of being retained.  [default: False]
     --o-filtered-data ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     The resulting filtered sequences.  [required
                                     if not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.

         <pre>Filter features from sequences

   Filter features from sequences based on a feature table or metadata. See
   the filtering tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.
   This method can filter based on ids in a table or a metadata file, but not
   both (i.e., the table and metadata options are mutually exclusive).

   Parameters
   ----------
   data : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences from which features should be filtered.
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency], optional
       Table containing feature ids used for id-based filtering.
   metadata : Metadata, optional
       Feature metadata used for id-based filtering, with `where` parameter
       when selecting features to retain, or with `exclude_ids` when selecting
       features to discard.
   where : Str, optional
       SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature metadata criteria that must be
       met to be included in the filtered feature table. If not provided, all
       features in `metadata` that are also in the sequences will be retained.
   exclude_ids : Bool, optional
       If true, the features selected by the `metadata` (with or without the
       `where` parameter) or `table` parameter will be excluded from the
       filtered sequences instead of being retained.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_data : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The resulting filtered sequences.</pre>
