     chimeras.

                                     the input sequences, which will be the bases
                                     that were sequenced in the last cycles.

                                     should be trimmed due to low quality. This
                                     trims the 5' end of the input sequences,
                                     which will be the bases that were sequenced
                                     in the first cycles.  [default: 0]

                                     detection. "consensus": Chimeras are
                                     detected in samples individually, and
                                     sequences found chimeric in a sufficient
                                     fraction of samples are removed.  [default:

     --p-min-fold-parent-over-abundance FLOAT
                                     The minimum abundance of potential parents
                                     of a sequence being tested as chimeric,
                                     expressed as a fold-change versus the
                                     abundance of the sequence being tested.
                                     Values should be greater than or equal to 1
                                     (i.e. parents should be more abundant than
                                     the sequence being tested). This parameter
                                     has no effect if chimera_method is "none".

     --p-n-threads INTEGER           The number of threads to use for
                                     multithreaded processing. If 0 is provided,

                                     error model. Smaller numbers will result in
                                     a shorter run time but a less reliable error
                                     model.  [default: 1000000]
     --p-hashed-feature-ids / --p-no-hashed-feature-ids
                                     If true, the feature ids in the resulting
                                     table will be presented as hashes of the
                                     sequences defining each feature. The hash
                                     will always be the same for the same
                                     sequence so this allows feature tables to be
                                     merged across runs of this method. You
                                     should only merge tables if the exact same
                                     parameters are used for each run.  [default:

                                     feature in the feature table will be
                                     represented by exactly one sequence, and
                                     these sequences will be the joined paired-
                                     end sequences.  [required if not passing

         <pre>Denoise and dereplicate paired-end sequences

   This method denoises paired-end sequences, dereplicates them, and filters
   chimeras.

   Parameters
   ----------
   demultiplexed_seqs : SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]
       The paired-end demultiplexed sequences to be denoised.
   trunc_len_f : Int
       Position at which forward read sequences should be truncated due to
       decrease in quality. This truncates the 3' end of the of the input
       sequences, which will be the bases that were sequenced in the last
       cycles. Reads that are shorter than this value will be discarded. After
       this parameter is applied there must still be at least a 20 nucleotide
       overlap between the forward and reverse reads. If 0 is provided, no
       truncation or length filtering will be performed
   trunc_len_r : Int
       Position at which reverse read sequences should be truncated due to
       decrease in quality. This truncates the 3' end of the of the input
       sequences, which will be the bases that were sequenced in the last
       cycles. Reads that are shorter than this value will be discarded. After
       this parameter is applied there must still be at least a 20 nucleotide
       overlap between the forward and reverse reads. If 0 is provided, no
       truncation or length filtering will be performed
   trim_left_f : Int, optional
       Position at which forward read sequences should be trimmed due to low
       quality. This trims the 5' end of the input sequences, which will be
       the bases that were sequenced in the first cycles.
   trim_left_r : Int, optional
       Position at which reverse read sequences should be trimmed due to low
       quality. This trims the 5' end of the input sequences, which will be
       the bases that were sequenced in the first cycles.
   max_ee : Float, optional
       Reads with number of expected errors higher than this value will be
       discarded.
   trunc_q : Int, optional
       Reads are truncated at the first instance of a quality score less than
       or equal to this value. If the resulting read is then shorter than
       `trunc_len_f` or `trunc_len_r` (depending on the direction of the read)
       it is discarded.
   chimera_method : Str % Choices({'consensus', 'none', 'pooled'}), optional
       The method used to remove chimeras. "none": No chimera removal is
       performed. "pooled": All reads are pooled prior to chimera detection.
       "consensus": Chimeras are detected in samples individually, and
       sequences found chimeric in a sufficient fraction of samples are
       removed.
   min_fold_parent_over_abundance : Float, optional
       The minimum abundance of potential parents of a sequence being tested
       as chimeric, expressed as a fold-change versus the abundance of the
       sequence being tested. Values should be greater than or equal to 1
       (i.e. parents should be more abundant than the sequence being tested).
       This parameter has no effect if chimera_method is "none".
   n_threads : Int, optional
       The number of threads to use for multithreaded processing. If 0 is
       provided, all available cores will be used.
   n_reads_learn : Int, optional
       The number of reads to use when training the error model. Smaller
       numbers will result in a shorter run time but a less reliable error
       model.
   hashed_feature_ids : Bool, optional
       If true, the feature ids in the resulting table will be presented as
       hashes of the sequences defining each feature. The hash will always be
       the same for the same sequence so this allows feature tables to be
       merged across runs of this method. You should only merge tables if the
       exact same parameters are used for each run.

   Returns
   -------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The resulting feature table.
   representative_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The resulting feature sequences. Each feature in the feature table will
       be represented by exactly one sequence, and these sequences will be the
       joined paired-end sequences.
