         <pre>Usage: qiime phylogeny align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree [OPTIONS]

     This pipeline will start by creating a sequence alignment using MAFFT,
     after which any alignment columns that are phylogenetically uninformative
     or ambiguously aligned will be removed (masked). The resulting masked
     alignment will be used to infer a phylogenetic tree and then subsequently
     rooted at its midpoint. Output files from each step of the pipeline will
     be saved. This includes both the unmasked and masked MAFFT alignment from
     q2-alignment methods, and both the rooted and unrooted phylogenies from
     q2-phylogeny methods.

   Options:
     --i-sequences ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     The sequences to be used for creating a
                                     fasttree based rooted phylogenetic tree.
                                     [required]
     --p-n-threads INTEGER RANGE     The number of threads. (Use 0 to
                                     automatically use all available cores) This
                                     value is used when aligning the sequences
                                     and creating the tree with fasttree.
                                     [default: 1]
     --p-mask-max-gap-frequency FLOAT
                                     The maximum relative frequency of gap
                                     characters in a column for the column to be
                                     retained. This relative frequency must be a
                                     number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive),
                                     where 0.0 retains only those columns without
                                     gap characters, and 1.0 retains all columns
                                     regardless of gap character frequency. This
                                     value is used when masking the aligned
                                     sequences.  [default: 1.0]
     --p-mask-min-conservation FLOAT
                                     The minimum relative frequency of at least
                                     one non-gap character in a column for that
                                     column to be retained. This relative
                                     frequency must be a number between 0.0 and
                                     1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a value of
                                     0.4 is provided, a column will only be
                                     retained  if it contains at least one
                                     character that is present in at least 40% of
                                     the sequences. This value is used when
                                     masking the aligned sequences.  [default:
                                     0.4]

                                     The masked alignment.  [required if not

     --o-rooted-tree ARTIFACT PATH Phylogeny[Rooted]
                                     The rooted phylogenetic tree.  [required if
                                     not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory

         <pre>Build a phylogenetic tree using fasttree and mafft alignment

   This pipeline will start by creating a sequence alignment using MAFFT,
   after which any alignment columns that are phylogenetically uninformative
   or ambiguously aligned will be removed (masked). The resulting masked
   alignment will be used to infer a phylogenetic tree and then subsequently
   rooted at its midpoint. Output files from each step of the pipeline will be
   saved. This includes both the unmasked and masked MAFFT alignment from
   q2-alignment methods, and both the rooted and unrooted phylogenies from
   q2-phylogeny methods.

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences to be used for creating a fasttree based rooted
       phylogenetic tree.
   n_threads : Int % Range(0, None), optional
       The number of threads. (Use 0 to automatically use all available cores)
       This value is used when aligning the sequences and creating the tree
       with fasttree.
   mask_max_gap_frequency : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The maximum relative frequency of gap characters in a column for the
       column to be retained. This relative frequency must be a number between
       0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive), where 0.0 retains only those columns without
       gap characters, and 1.0 retains all columns  regardless of gap
       character frequency. This value is used when masking the aligned
       sequences.
   mask_min_conservation : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The minimum relative frequency of at least one non-gap character in a
       column for that column to be retained. This relative frequency must be
       a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a value of
       0.4 is provided, a column will only be retained  if it contains at
       least one character that is present in at least 40% of the sequences.
       This value is used when masking the aligned sequences.

   Returns
   -------
   alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
       The aligned sequences.
   masked_alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
       The masked alignment.
   tree : Phylogeny[Unrooted]
       The unrooted phylogenetic tree.
   rooted_tree : Phylogeny[Rooted]
       The rooted phylogenetic tree.</pre>
