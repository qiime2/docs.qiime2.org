     This method filters sequences based on their taxonomic annotations.
     Features can be retained in the result by specifying one or more include
     search terms, and can be filtered out of the result by specifying one or
     more exclude search terms. If both include and exclude are provided, the
     inclusion critera will be applied before the exclusion critera. Either
     include or exclude terms (or both) must be provided.

   Options:
     --i-sequences ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     Feature sequences to be filtered.
                                     [required]
     --i-taxonomy ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Taxonomy]
                                     Taxonomic annotations for features in the
                                     provided feature sequences. All features in
                                     the feature sequences must have a
                                     corresponding taxonomic annotation.
                                     Taxonomic annotations for features that are
                                     not present in the feature sequences will be
                                     ignored.  [required]
     --p-include TEXT                One or more search terms that indicate which
                                     taxa should be included in the resulting
                                     sequences. If providing more than one term,
                                     terms should be delimited by the query-
                                     delimiter character. By default, all taxa
                                     will be included.  [optional]
     --p-exclude TEXT                One or more search terms that indicate which
                                     taxa should be excluded from the resulting
                                     sequences. If providing more than one term,
                                     terms should be delimited by the query-
                                     delimiter character. By default, no taxa
                                     will be excluded.  [optional]
     --p-query-delimiter TEXT        The string used to delimit multiple search
                                     terms provided to include or exclude. This
                                     parameter should only need to be modified if
                                     the default delimiter (a comma) is used in
                                     the provided taxonomic annotations.
                                     [default: ,]
     --p-mode [exact|contains]       Mode for determining if a search term
                                     matches a taxonomic annotation. "contains"
                                     requires that the annotation has the term as
                                     a substring; "exact" requires that the
                                     annotation is a perfect match to a search
                                     term.  [default: contains]
     --o-filtered-sequences ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     The taxonomy-filtered feature sequences.
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.

   This method filters sequences based on their taxonomic annotations.
   Features can be retained in the result by specifying one or more include
   search terms, and can be filtered out of the result by specifying one or
   more exclude search terms. If both include and exclude are provided, the
   inclusion critera will be applied before the exclusion critera. Either
   include or exclude terms (or both) must be provided.

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       Feature sequences to be filtered.
   taxonomy : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided feature sequences.
       All features in the feature sequences must have a corresponding
       taxonomic annotation. Taxonomic annotations for features that are not
       present in the feature sequences will be ignored.
   include : Str, optional
       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa should be included in
       the resulting sequences. If providing more than one term, terms should
       be delimited by the query-delimiter character. By default, all taxa
       will be included.
   exclude : Str, optional
       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa should be excluded
       from the resulting sequences. If providing more than one term, terms
       should be delimited by the query-delimiter character. By default, no
       taxa will be excluded.
   query_delimiter : Str, optional
       The string used to delimit multiple search terms provided to include or
       exclude. This parameter should only need to be modified if the default
       delimiter (a comma) is used in the provided taxonomic annotations.
   mode : Str % Choices({'contains', 'exact'}), optional
       Mode for determining if a search term matches a taxonomic annotation.
       "contains" requires that the annotation has the term as a substring;
       "exact" requires that the annotation is a perfect match to a search
       term.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The taxonomy-filtered feature sequences.</pre>
