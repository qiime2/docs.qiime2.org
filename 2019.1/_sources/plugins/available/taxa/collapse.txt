         <pre>Usage: qiime taxa collapse [OPTIONS]

     Collapse groups of features that have the same taxonomic assignment
     through the specified level. The frequencies of all features will be
     summed when they are collapsed.

   Options:
     --i-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     Feature table to be collapsed.  [required]
     --i-taxonomy ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Taxonomy]
                                     Taxonomic annotations for features in the
                                     provided feature table. All features in the
                                     feature table must have a corresponding
                                     taxonomic annotation. Taxonomic annotations
                                     that are not present in the feature table
                                     will be ignored.  [required]
     --p-level INTEGER               The taxonomic level at which the features
                                     should be collapsed. All ouput features will
                                     have exactly this many levels of taxonomic
                                     annotation.  [required]
     --o-collapsed-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     The resulting feature table, where all
                                     features are now taxonomic annotations with
                                     the user-specified number of levels.
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config FILE               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]
     --citations                     Show citations and exit.
     --help                          Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Collapse features by their taxonomy at the specified level

   Collapse groups of features that have the same taxonomic assignment through
   the specified level. The frequencies of all features will be summed when
   they are collapsed.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       Feature table to be collapsed.
   taxonomy : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided feature table. All
       features in the feature table must have a corresponding taxonomic
       annotation. Taxonomic annotations that are not present in the feature
       table will be ignored.
   level : Int
       The taxonomic level at which the features should be collapsed. All
       ouput features will have exactly this many levels of taxonomic
       annotation.

   Returns
   -------
   collapsed_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The resulting feature table, where all features are now taxonomic
       annotations with the user-specified number of levels.</pre>
