     Determine whether groups of samples are significantly different from one
     another using the ADONIS permutation-based statistical test in vegan-R.
     The function partitions sums of squares of a multivariate data set, and is
     directly analogous to MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance). This
     action differs from beta_group_signficance in that it accepts R formulae
     to perform multi-way ADONIS tests; beta_group_signficance only performs
     one-way tests. For more details see
     http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/softhelp/vegan/html/adonis.html

     --m-metadata-file MULTIPLE FILE
                                     Metadata file or artifact viewable as
                                     metadata. This option may be supplied
                                     multiple times to merge metadata. Sample
                                     metadata containing formula terms.

                                     These can be continuous variables or
                                     factors, and they can have interactions as
                                     in a typical R formula. E.g., the formula
                                     "treatment+block" would test whether the
                                     input distance matrix partitions based on
                                     "treatment" and "block" sample metadata. The
                                     formula "treatment*block" would test both of
                                     those effects as well as their interaction.
                                     Enclose formulae in quotes to avoid
                                     unpleasant surprises.  [required]
     --p-permutations INTEGER RANGE  The number of permutations to be run when

   Parameters
   ----------
   distance_matrix : DistanceMatrix
       Matrix of distances between pairs of samples.
   metadata : Metadata
       Sample metadata containing formula terms.
   formula : Str
       Model formula containing only independent terms contained in the sample
       metadata. These can be continuous variables or factors, and they can
       have interactions as in a typical R formula. E.g., the formula
       "treatment+block" would test whether the input distance matrix
       partitions based on "treatment" and "block" sample metadata. The
       formula "treatment*block" would test both of those effects as well as
       their interaction. Enclose formulae in quotes to avoid unpleasant
       surprises.
   permutations : Int % Range(1, None), optional
       The number of permutations to be run when computing p-values.
   n_jobs : Int % Range(1, None), optional
       Number of parallel processes to run.
