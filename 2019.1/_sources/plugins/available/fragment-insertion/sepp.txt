         <pre>Usage: qiime fragment-insertion sepp [OPTIONS]

     Perform fragment insertion of 16S sequences using the SEPP algorithm
     against the Greengenes 13_8 99% tree.

   Options:
     --i-representative-sequences ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     The sequences to insert  [required]
     --p-threads INTEGER             The number of threads to use  [default: 1]
     --p-alignment-subset-size INTEGER
                                     Each placement subset is further broken into
                                     subsets of at most these many sequences and
                                     a separate HMM is trained on each subset.
                                     The default alignment subset size is set to
                                     balance the exhaustiveness of the alignment
                                     step with the running time.  [default: 1000]
     --p-placement-subset-size INTEGER
                                     The tree is divided into subsets such that
                                     each subset includes at most these many
                                     subsets. The placement step places the
                                     fragment on only one subset, determined
                                     based on alignment scores. The default
                                     placement subset is set to make sure the
                                     memory requirement of the pplacer step does
                                     not become prohibitively large.

                                     used to construct the reference phylogeny.

     --i-reference-phylogeny ARTIFACT PATH Phylogeny[Rooted]
                                     The rooted reference phylogeny. Must be in
                                     sync with reference-alignment, i.e. each tip
                                     name must have exactly one corresponding
                                     record.  [optional]
     --p-debug / --p-no-debug        Print additional run information to STDOUT
                                     for debugging. Run together with --verbose
                                     to actually see the information on STDOUT.
                                     Temporary directories will not be removed if
                                     run fails.  [default: False]

         <pre>Insert fragment sequences using SEPP into reference phylogenies like
   Greengenes 13_8

   Perform fragment insertion of 16S sequences using the SEPP algorithm
   against the Greengenes 13_8 99% tree.

   Parameters
   ----------
   representative_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences to insert
   threads : Int, optional
       The number of threads to use
   alignment_subset_size : Int, optional
       Each placement subset is further broken into subsets of at most these
       many sequences and a separate HMM is trained on each subset. The
       default alignment subset size is set to balance the exhaustiveness of
       the alignment step with the running time.
   placement_subset_size : Int, optional
       The tree is divided into subsets such that each subset includes at most
       these many subsets. The placement step places the fragment on only one
       subset, determined based on alignment scores. The default placement
       subset is set to make sure the memory requirement of the pplacer step
       does not become prohibitively large. Further reading:

       tutorial.md#sample-datasets-default-parameters
   reference_alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence], optional
       The reference multiple nucleotide alignment used to construct the
       reference phylogeny.
   reference_phylogeny : Phylogeny[Rooted], optional
       The rooted reference phylogeny. Must be in sync with reference-
       alignment, i.e. each tip name must have exactly one corresponding
       record.
   debug : Bool, optional
       Print additional run information to STDOUT for debugging. Run together
       with --verbose to actually see the information on STDOUT. Temporary
       directories will not be removed if run fails.

   Returns
   -------
   tree : Phylogeny[Rooted]
       The tree with inserted feature data
