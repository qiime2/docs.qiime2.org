         <pre>Usage: qiime quality-filter q-score-joined [OPTIONS]

     This method filters joined sequence based on quality scores and the
     presence of ambiguous base calls.

   Options:
     --i-demux ARTIFACT PATH SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
                                     The demultiplexed sequence data to be
                                     quality filtered.  [required]
     --p-min-quality INTEGER         The minimum acceptable PHRED score. All
                                     PHRED scores less that this value are
                                     considered to be low PHRED scores.
                                     [default: 4]
     --p-quality-window INTEGER      The maximum number of low PHRED scores that
                                     can be observed in direct succession before
                                     truncating a sequence read.  [default: 3]
     --p-min-length-fraction FLOAT   The minimum length that a sequence read can
                                     be following truncation and still be
                                     retained. This length should be provided as
                                     a fraction of the input sequence length.
                                     [default: 0.75]
     --p-max-ambiguous INTEGER       The maximum number of ambiguous (i.e., N)
                                     base calls. This is applied after trimming
                                     sequences based on `min_length_fraction`.
                                     [default: 0]
     --o-filtered-sequences ARTIFACT PATH SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
                                     The resulting quality-filtered sequences.
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --o-filter-stats ARTIFACT PATH QualityFilterStats
                                     Summary statistics of the filtering process.
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config FILE               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]
     --citations                     Show citations and exit.
     --help                          Show this message and exit.</pre>

       <h4>Docstring:</h4>
         <pre>Quality filter based on joined sequence quality scores.

   This method filters joined sequence based on quality scores and the
   presence of ambiguous base calls.

   Parameters
   ----------
   demux : SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
       The demultiplexed sequence data to be quality filtered.
   min_quality : Int, optional
       The minimum acceptable PHRED score. All PHRED scores less that this
       value are considered to be low PHRED scores.
   quality_window : Int, optional
       The maximum number of low PHRED scores that can be observed in direct
       succession before truncating a sequence read.
   min_length_fraction : Float, optional
       The minimum length that a sequence read can be following truncation and
       still be retained. This length should be provided as a fraction of the
       input sequence length.
   max_ambiguous : Int, optional
       The maximum number of ambiguous (i.e., N) base calls. This is applied
       after trimming sequences based on `min_length_fraction`.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_sequences : SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
       The resulting quality-filtered sequences.
   filter_stats : QualityFilterStats
       Summary statistics of the filtering process.</pre>
