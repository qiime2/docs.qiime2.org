         <pre>Usage: qiime vsearch dereplicate-sequences [OPTIONS]

     Dereplicate sequence data and create a feature table and feature
     representative sequences. Feature identifiers in the resulting artifacts
     will be the sha1 hash of the sequence defining each feature. If clustering
     of features into OTUs is desired, the resulting artifacts can be passed to
     the cluster_features_* methods in this plugin.

   Options:
     --i-sequences ARTIFACT PATH SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality] | SampleData[SequencesWithQuality] | SampleData[Sequences]
                                     The sequences to be dereplicated.
                                     [required]
     --p-derep-prefix / --p-no-derep-prefix
                                     Merge sequences with identical prefixes. If
                                     a sequence is identical to the prefix of two
                                     or more longer sequences, it is clustered
                                     with the shortest of them. If they are
                                     equally long, it is clustered with the most
                                     abundant.  [default: False]
     --o-dereplicated-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     The table of dereplicated sequences.
                                     [required if not passing --output-dir]
     --o-dereplicated-sequences ARTIFACT PATH FeatureData[Sequence]
                                     The dereplicated sequences.  [required if
                                     not passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config FILE               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]
     --citations                     Show citations and exit.

         <pre>Dereplicate sequences.

   Dereplicate sequence data and create a feature table and feature
   representative sequences. Feature identifiers in the resulting artifacts

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality] | SampleData[SequencesWithQuality] | SampleData[Sequences]
       The sequences to be dereplicated.
   derep_prefix : Bool, optional
       Merge sequences with identical prefixes. If a sequence is identical to
       the prefix of two or more longer sequences, it is clustered with the
       shortest of them. If they are equally long, it is clustered with the
       most abundant.

   Returns
   -------
   dereplicated_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The table of dereplicated sequences.
   dereplicated_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The dereplicated sequences.</pre>
