         <pre>Usage: qiime quality-control evaluate-taxonomy [OPTIONS]

     This visualizer compares a pair of observed and expected taxonomic
     assignments to calculate precision, recall, and F-measure at each
     taxonomic level, up to maximum level specified by the depth parameter.
     These metrics are calculated at each semicolon-delimited rank. This action
     is useful for comparing the accuracy of taxonomic assignment, e.g.,
     between different taxonomy classifiers or other bioinformatics methods.
     Expected taxonomies should be derived from simulated or mock community
     sequences that have known taxonomic affiliations.

         <pre>Evaluate expected vs. observed taxonomic assignments

   This visualizer compares a pair of observed and expected taxonomic
   assignments to calculate precision, recall, and F-measure at each taxonomic
   level, up to maximum level specified by the depth parameter. These metrics
   are calculated at each semicolon-delimited rank. This action is useful for
   comparing the accuracy of taxonomic assignment, e.g., between different
   taxonomy classifiers or other bioinformatics methods. Expected taxonomies
   should be derived from simulated or mock community sequences that have
   known taxonomic affiliations.

   Parameters
   ----------
   expected_taxa : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Expected taxonomic assignments
   observed_taxa : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Observed taxonomic assignments
   depth : Int
       Maximum depth of semicolon-delimited taxonomic ranks to test (e.g., 1 =
       root, 7 = species for the greengenes reference sequence database).
   palette : Str % Choices({'Accent', 'Dark2', 'Paired', 'Pastel1', 'Pastel2', 'Set1', 'Set2', 'Set3', 'inferno', 'magma', 'plasma', 'rainbow', 'tab10', 'tab20', 'tab20b', 'tab20c', 'terrain', 'viridis'}), optional
       Color palette to utilize for plotting.
   require_exp_ids : Bool, optional
       Require that all features found in observed taxa must be found in
       expected taxa or raise error.
   require_obs_ids : Bool, optional
       Require that all features found in expected taxa must be found in
       observed taxa or raise error.
   feature_table : FeatureTable[RelativeFrequency], optional
       Optional feature table containing relative frequency of each feature,
       used to weight accuracy scores by frequency. Must contain all features
       found in expected and/or observed taxa. Features found in the table but
       not the expected/observed taxa will be dropped prior to analysis.
   sample_id : Str, optional
       Optional sample ID to use for extracting frequency data from feature
       table, and for labeling accuracy results. If no sample_id is provided,
       feature frequencies are derived from the sum of all samples present in
       the feature table.
