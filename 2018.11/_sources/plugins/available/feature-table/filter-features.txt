         <pre>Usage: qiime feature-table filter-features [OPTIONS]

     Filter features from table based on frequency and/or metadata. Any samples
     with a frequency of zero after feature filtering will also be removed. See
     the filtering tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.

   Options:
     --i-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     The feature table from which features should
                                     be filtered.  [required]
     --p-min-frequency INTEGER       The minimum total frequency that a feature
                                     must have to be retained.  [default: 0]
     --p-max-frequency INTEGER       The maximum total frequency that a feature
                                     can have to be retained. If no value is
                                     provided this will default to infinity
                                     (i.e., no maximum frequency filter will be
                                     applied).  [optional]
     --p-min-samples INTEGER         The minimum number of samples that a feature
                                     must be observed in to be retained.
                                     [default: 0]
     --p-max-samples INTEGER         The maximum number of samples that a feature
                                     can be observed in to be retained. If no
                                     value is provided this will default to
                                     infinity (i.e., no maximum sample filter
                                     will be applied).  [optional]
     --m-metadata-file MULTIPLE FILE
                                     Metadata file or artifact viewable as
                                     metadata. This option may be supplied
                                     multiple times to merge metadata. Feature
                                     metadata used with `where` parameter when
                                     selecting features to retain, or with
                                     `exclude_ids` when selecting features to
                                     discard.  [optional]
     --p-where TEXT                  SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature
                                     metadata criteria that must be met to be
                                     included in the filtered feature table. If
                                     not provided, all features in `metadata`
                                     that are also in the feature table will be
                                     retained.  [optional]
     --p-exclude-ids / --p-no-exclude-ids
                                     If true, the features selected by `metadata`
                                     or `where` parameters will be excluded from
                                     the filtered table instead of being
                                     retained.  [default: False]
     --o-filtered-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     The resulting feature table filtered by
                                     feature.  [required if not passing --output-
                                     dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config FILE               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]
     --citations                     Show citations and exit.
     --help                          Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Filter features from table

   Filter features from table based on frequency and/or metadata. Any samples
   with a frequency of zero after feature filtering will also be removed. See
   the filtering tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table from which features should be filtered.
   min_frequency : Int, optional
       The minimum total frequency that a feature must have to be retained.
   max_frequency : Int, optional
       The maximum total frequency that a feature can have to be retained. If
       no value is provided this will default to infinity (i.e., no maximum
       frequency filter will be applied).
   min_samples : Int, optional
       The minimum number of samples that a feature must be observed in to be
       retained.
   max_samples : Int, optional
       The maximum number of samples that a feature can be observed in to be
       retained. If no value is provided this will default to infinity (i.e.,
       no maximum sample filter will be applied).
   metadata : Metadata, optional
       Feature metadata used with `where` parameter when selecting features to
       retain, or with `exclude_ids` when selecting features to discard.
   where : Str, optional
       SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature metadata criteria that must be
       met to be included in the filtered feature table. If not provided, all
       features in `metadata` that are also in the feature table will be
       retained.
   exclude_ids : Bool, optional
       If true, the features selected by `metadata` or `where` parameters will
       be excluded from the filtered table instead of being retained.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The resulting feature table filtered by feature.</pre>
