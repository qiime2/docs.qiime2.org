         <pre>Usage: qiime fragment-insertion filter-features [OPTIONS]

     Filters fragments not inserted into a phylogenetic tree from a feature-
     table. Some fragments computed by e.g. Deblur or DADA2 are too remote to
     get inserted by SEPP into a reference phylogeny. To be able to use the
     feature-table for downstream analyses like computing Faith's PD or
     UniFrac, the feature-table must be cleared of fragments that are not part
     of the phylogenetic tree, because their path length can otherwise not be
     determined. Typically, the number of rejected fragments is low (<= 10),
     but it might be worth to inspect the ratio of reads assigned to those
     rejected fragments.

   Options:
     --i-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     A feature-table which needs to filtered down
                                     to those fragments that are contained in the
                                     tree, e.g. result of a Deblur or DADA2 run.
                                     [required]
     --i-tree ARTIFACT PATH Phylogeny[Rooted]
                                     The tree resulting from inserting fragments
                                     into a reference phylogeny, i.e. the output
                                     of function 'sepp'  [required]
     --o-filtered-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     The input table minus those fragments that
                                     were not part of the tree. This feature-
                                     table can be used for downstream analyses
                                     like phylogenetic alpha- or beta- diversity
                                     computation.  [required if not passing
                                     --output-dir]
     --o-removed-table ARTIFACT PATH FeatureTable[Frequency]
                                     Those fragments that got removed from the
                                     input table, because they were not part of
                                     the tree. This table is mainly used for
                                     quality control, e.g. to inspect the ratio
                                     of removed reads per sample from the input
                                     table. You can ignore this table for
                                     downstream analyses.  [required if not
                                     passing --output-dir]
     --output-dir DIRECTORY          Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config FILE               Use config file for command options
     --verbose                       Display verbose output to stdout and/or
                                     stderr during execution of this action.
                                     [default: False]
     --quiet                         Silence output if execution is successful
                                     (silence is golden).  [default: False]
     --citations                     Show citations and exit.
     --help                          Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Filter fragments in tree from table.

   Filters fragments not inserted into a phylogenetic tree from a feature-
   table. Some fragments computed by e.g. Deblur or DADA2 are too remote to
   get inserted by SEPP into a reference phylogeny. To be able to use the
   feature-table for downstream analyses like computing Faith's PD or UniFrac,
   the feature-table must be cleared of fragments that are not part of the

   determined. Typically, the number of rejected fragments is low (<= 10), but
   it might be worth to inspect the ratio of reads assigned to those rejected
   fragments.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       A feature-table which needs to filtered down to those fragments that
       are contained in the tree, e.g. result of a Deblur or DADA2 run.
   tree : Phylogeny[Rooted]
       The tree resulting from inserting fragments into a reference phylogeny,
       i.e. the output of function 'sepp'

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The input table minus those fragments that were not part of the tree.
       This feature-table can be used for downstream analyses like
       phylogenetic alpha- or beta- diversity computation.
   removed_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       Those fragments that got removed from the input table, because they
       were not part of the tree. This table is mainly used for quality
       control, e.g. to inspect the ratio of removed reads per sample from the
       input table. You can ignore this table for downstream analyses.</pre>
