     This method filters sequences based on their taxonomic annotations.
     Features can be retained in the result by specifying one or more include
     search terms, and can be filtered out of the result by specifying one or
     more exclude search terms. If both include and exclude are provided, the
     inclusion critera will be applied before the exclusion critera. Either
     include or exclude terms (or both) must be provided.

   Options:
     --i-sequences PATH           Artifact: FeatureData[Sequence]  [required]
                                  Feature sequences to be filtered.
     --i-taxonomy PATH            Artifact: FeatureData[Taxonomy]  [required]
                                  Taxonomic annotations for features in the
                                  provided feature sequences. All features in the
                                  feature sequences must have a corresponding
                                  taxonomic annotation. Taxonomic annotations for
                                  features that are not present in the feature
                                  sequences will be ignored.
     --p-include TEXT             [optional]
                                  One or more search terms that
                                  indicate which taxa should be included in the
                                  resulting sequences. If providing more than one
                                  term, terms should be delimited by the query-
                                  delimiter character. By default, all taxa will
                                  be included.
     --p-exclude TEXT             [optional]
                                  One or more search terms that
                                  indicate which taxa should be excluded from the
                                  resulting sequences. If providing more than one
                                  term, terms should be delimited by the query-
                                  delimiter character. By default, no taxa will
                                  be excluded.
     --p-query-delimiter TEXT     [default: ,]
                                  The string used to delimit
                                  multiple search terms provided to include or
                                  exclude. This parameter should only need to be
                                  modified if the default delimiter (a comma) is
                                  used in the provided taxonomic annotations.
     --p-mode [exact|contains]    [default: contains]
                                  Mode for determining if a
                                  search term matches a taxonomic annotation.
                                  "contains" requires that the annotation has the
                                  term as a substring; "exact" requires that the
                                  annotation is a perfect match to a search term.
     --o-filtered-sequences PATH  Artifact: FeatureData[Sequence] [required if
                                  not passing --output-dir]
                                  The taxonomy-filtered
                                  feature sequences.
     --output-dir DIRECTORY       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --cmd-config PATH            Use config file for command options
     --verbose                    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                                  during execution of this action.  [default:
                                  False]
     --quiet                      Silence output if execution is successful
                                  (silence is golden).  [default: False]
     --help                       Show this message and exit.</pre>

   This method filters sequences based on their taxonomic annotations.
   Features can be retained in the result by specifying one or more include
   search terms, and can be filtered out of the result by specifying one or
   more exclude search terms. If both include and exclude are provided, the
   inclusion critera will be applied before the exclusion critera. Either
   include or exclude terms (or both) must be provided.

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       Feature sequences to be filtered.
   taxonomy : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided feature sequences.
       All features in the feature sequences must have a corresponding
       taxonomic annotation. Taxonomic annotations for features that are not
       present in the feature sequences will be ignored.
   include : Str, optional
       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa should be included in
       the resulting sequences. If providing more than one term, terms should
       be delimited by the query-delimiter character. By default, all taxa
       will be included.
   exclude : Str, optional
       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa should be excluded
       from the resulting sequences. If providing more than one term, terms
       should be delimited by the query-delimiter character. By default, no
       taxa will be excluded.
   query_delimiter : Str, optional
       The string used to delimit multiple search terms provided to include or
       exclude. This parameter should only need to be modified if the default
       delimiter (a comma) is used in the provided taxonomic annotations.
   mode : Str % Choices({'contains', 'exact'}), optional
       Mode for determining if a search term matches a taxonomic annotation.
       "contains" requires that the annotation has the term as a substring;
       "exact" requires that the annotation is a perfect match to a search
       term.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The taxonomy-filtered feature sequences.</pre>
