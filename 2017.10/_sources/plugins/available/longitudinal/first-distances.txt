         <pre>Usage: qiime longitudinal first-distances [OPTIONS]

     Calculates first distances between sequential states for samples collected
     from individual subjects sampled repeatedly at two or more states. This
     method is similar to the "first differences" method, except that it
     requires a distance matrix as input and calculates first differences as
     distances between successive states. Outputs a data series of first
     distances for each individual subject at each sequential pair of states,
     labeled by the SampleID of the second state (e.g., paired distances
     between time 0 and time 1 would be labeled by the SampleIDs at time 1).
     This file can be used as input to linear mixed effects models or other
     longitudinal or diversity methods to compare changes in first distances
     across time or among groups of subjects.

         <pre>First distance computation between sequential states

   Calculates first distances between sequential states for samples collected
   from individual subjects sampled repeatedly at two or more states. This
   method is similar to the "first differences" method, except that it
   requires a distance matrix as input and calculates first differences as
   distances between successive states. Outputs a data series of first
   distances for each individual subject at each sequential pair of states,
   labeled by the SampleID of the second state (e.g., paired distances between

   can be used as input to linear mixed effects models or other longitudinal
   or diversity methods to compare changes in first distances across time or
   among groups of subjects.

   Parameters
   ----------
   distance_matrix : DistanceMatrix
       Matrix of distances between pairs of samples.
   metadata : Metadata
       Sample metadata file containing individual_id_column.
   state_column : Str
       Metadata column containing state (e.g., Time) across which samples are
       paired.
   individual_id_column : Str
       Metadata column containing IDs for individual subjects.
   replicate_handling : Str % Choices({'drop', 'error', 'random'}), optional
       Choose how replicate samples are handled. If replicates are detected,
       "error" causes method to fail; "drop" will discard all replicated
       samples; "random" chooses one representative at random from among
       replicates.

   Returns
   -------
   first_distances : SampleData[FirstDifferences]
       Series of first distances.</pre>
