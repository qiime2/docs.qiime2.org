         <pre>Usage: qiime longitudinal first-differences [OPTIONS]

     Calculates first differences in "metric" between sequential states for
     samples collected from individual subjects sampled repeatedly at two or
     more states. First differences can be performed on a metadata column
     (including artifacts that can be input as metadata) or a feature in a
     feature table. Outputs a data series of first differences for each
     individual subject at each sequential pair of states, labeled by the
     SampleID of the second state (e.g., paired differences between time 0 and
     time 1 would be labeled by the SampleIDs at time 1). This file can be used
     as input to linear mixed effects models or other longitudinal or diversity
     methods to compare changes in first differences across time or among
     groups of subjects.

   Options:

                                     metadata. This option may be supplied

                                     Metadata column containing state
                                     (e.g., Time) across which samples are

                                     samples are handled. If replicates are

                                     "drop" will discard all replicated samples;
                                     "random" chooses one representative at

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[RelativeFrequency], optional
       Feature table to optionally use for computing first differences.
   metadata : Metadata
       Sample metadata file containing individual_id_column.
   state_column : Str
       Metadata column containing state (e.g., Time) across which samples are
       paired.
   individual_id_column : Str
       Metadata column containing IDs for individual subjects.
   metric : Str
       Numerical metadata or artifact column to test.
   replicate_handling : Str % Choices({'drop', 'error', 'random'}), optional
       Choose how replicate samples are handled. If replicates are detected,
       "error" causes method to fail; "drop" will discard all replicated
       samples; "random" chooses one representative at random from among
       replicates.

   Returns
   -------
   first_differences : SampleData[FirstDifferences]
       Series of first differences.</pre>
