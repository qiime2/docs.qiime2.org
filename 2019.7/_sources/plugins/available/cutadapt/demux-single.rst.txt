     Demultiplex sequence data (i.e., map barcode reads to sample ids).
     Barcodes are expected to be located within the sequence data (versus the
     header, or a separate barcode file).

   Inputs:
     --i-seqs ARTIFACT MultiplexedSingleEndBarcodeInSequence
                             The single-end sequences to be demultiplexed.
                                                                       [required]
   Parameters:
     --m-barcodes-file METADATA
     --m-barcodes-column COLUMN  MetadataColumn[Categorical]
                             The sample metadata column listing the per-sample
                             barcodes.                                 [required]
     --p-error-rate PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True)
                             The level of error tolerance, specified as the
                             maximum allowable error rate. The default value
                             specified by cutadapt is 0.1 (=10%), which is
                             greater than `demux emp-*`, which is 0.0 (=0%).
                                                                   [default: 0.1]
     --p-batch-size INTEGER  The number of samples cutadapt demultiplexes
       Range(0, None)        concurrently. Demultiplexing in smaller batches will
                             yield the same result with marginal speed loss, and
                             may solve "too many files" errors related to sample
                             quantity. Set to "0" to process all samples at once.
                                                                     [default: 0]
     --p-minimum-length INTEGER
       Range(1, None)        Discard reads shorter than specified value. Note,
                             the cutadapt default of 0 has been overridden,
                             because that value produces empty sequence records.
                                                                     [default: 1]
   Outputs:
     --o-per-sample-sequences ARTIFACT SampleData[SequencesWithQuality]
                             The resulting demultiplexed sequences.    [required]
     --o-untrimmed-sequences ARTIFACT MultiplexedSingleEndBarcodeInSequence
                             The sequences that were unmatched to barcodes.
                                                                       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                             during execution of this action. Or silence output
                             if execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations             Show citations and exit.
     --help                  Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Demultiplex single-end sequence data with barcodes in-sequence.

   Demultiplex sequence data (i.e., map barcode reads to sample ids). Barcodes
   are expected to be located within the sequence data (versus the header, or
   a separate barcode file).

   Parameters
   ----------
   seqs : MultiplexedSingleEndBarcodeInSequence
       The single-end sequences to be demultiplexed.
   barcodes : MetadataColumn[Categorical]
       The sample metadata column listing the per-sample barcodes.
   error_rate : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The level of error tolerance, specified as the maximum allowable error
       rate. The default value specified by cutadapt is 0.1 (=10%), which is
       greater than `demux emp-*`, which is 0.0 (=0%).
   batch_size : Int % Range(0, None), optional
       The number of samples cutadapt demultiplexes concurrently.
       Demultiplexing in smaller batches will yield the same result with
       marginal speed loss, and may solve "too many files" errors related to
       sample quantity. Set to "0" to process all samples at once.
   minimum_length : Int % Range(1, None), optional
       Discard reads shorter than specified value. Note, the cutadapt default
       of 0 has been overridden, because that value produces empty sequence
       records.

   Returns
   -------
   per_sample_sequences : SampleData[SequencesWithQuality]
       The resulting demultiplexed sequences.
   untrimmed_sequences : MultiplexedSingleEndBarcodeInSequence
       The sequences that were unmatched to barcodes.</pre>
