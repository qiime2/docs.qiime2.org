         <pre>Usage: qiime taxa filter-seqs [OPTIONS]

     This method filters sequences based on their taxonomic annotations.
     Features can be retained in the result by specifying one or more include
     search terms, and can be filtered out of the result by specifying one or
     more exclude search terms. If both include and exclude are provided, the
     inclusion critera will be applied before the exclusion critera. Either
     include or exclude terms (or both) must be provided.

   Inputs:
     --i-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             Feature sequences to be filtered.         [required]
     --i-taxonomy ARTIFACT FeatureData[Taxonomy]
                             Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided
                             feature sequences. All features in the feature
                             sequences must have a corresponding taxonomic
                             annotation. Taxonomic annotations for features that
                             are not present in the feature sequences will be
                             ignored.                                  [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-include TEXT        One or more search terms that indicate which taxa
                             should be included in the resulting sequences. If
                             providing more than one term, terms should be
                             delimited by the query-delimiter character. By
                             default, all taxa will be included.       [optional]
     --p-exclude TEXT        One or more search terms that indicate which taxa
                             should be excluded from the resulting sequences. If
                             providing more than one term, terms should be
                             delimited by the query-delimiter character. By
                             default, no taxa will be excluded.        [optional]
     --p-query-delimiter TEXT
                             The string used to delimit multiple search terms
                             provided to include or exclude. This parameter
                             should only need to be modified if the default
                             delimiter (a comma) is used in the provided
                             taxonomic annotations.                [default: ',']
     --p-mode TEXT Choices('exact', 'contains')
                             Mode for determining if a search term matches a
                             taxonomic annotation. "contains" requires that the
                             annotation has the term as a substring; "exact"
                             requires that the annotation is a perfect match to a
                             search term.                   [default: 'contains']
   Outputs:
     --o-filtered-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             The taxonomy-filtered feature sequences.  [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                             during execution of this action. Or silence output
                             if execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations             Show citations and exit.
     --help                  Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Taxonomy-based feature sequence filter.

   This method filters sequences based on their taxonomic annotations.
   Features can be retained in the result by specifying one or more include
   search terms, and can be filtered out of the result by specifying one or
   more exclude search terms. If both include and exclude are provided, the
   inclusion critera will be applied before the exclusion critera. Either
   include or exclude terms (or both) must be provided.

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       Feature sequences to be filtered.
   taxonomy : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided feature sequences.
       All features in the feature sequences must have a corresponding
       taxonomic annotation. Taxonomic annotations for features that are not
       present in the feature sequences will be ignored.
   include : Str, optional
       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa should be included in
       the resulting sequences. If providing more than one term, terms should
       be delimited by the query-delimiter character. By default, all taxa
       will be included.
   exclude : Str, optional
       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa should be excluded
       from the resulting sequences. If providing more than one term, terms
       should be delimited by the query-delimiter character. By default, no
       taxa will be excluded.
   query_delimiter : Str, optional
       The string used to delimit multiple search terms provided to include or
       exclude. This parameter should only need to be modified if the default
       delimiter (a comma) is used in the provided taxonomic annotations.
   mode : Str % Choices('exact', 'contains'), optional
       Mode for determining if a search term matches a taxonomic annotation.
       "contains" requires that the annotation has the term as a substring;
       "exact" requires that the annotation is a perfect match to a search
       term.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The taxonomy-filtered feature sequences.</pre>
