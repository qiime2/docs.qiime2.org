         <pre>Usage: qiime taxa filter-table [OPTIONS]

     This method filters features from a table based on their taxonomic
     annotations. Features can be retained in the resulting table by specifying
     one or more include search terms, and can be filtered out of the resulting
     table by specifying one or more exclude search terms. If both include and
     exclude are provided, the inclusion critera will be applied before the
     exclusion critera. Either include or exclude terms (or both) must be
     provided. Any samples that have a total frequency of zero after filtering
     will be removed from the resulting table.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                            Feature table to be filtered.              [required]
     --i-taxonomy ARTIFACT FeatureData[Taxonomy]
                            Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided
                            feature table. All features in the feature table must
                            have a corresponding taxonomic annotation. Taxonomic
                            annotations for features that are not present in the
                            feature table will be ignored.             [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-include TEXT       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa
                            should be included in the resulting table. If
                            providing more than one term, terms should be
                            delimited by the query-delimiter character. By
                            default, all taxa will be included.        [optional]
     --p-exclude TEXT       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa
                            should be excluded from the resulting table. If
                            providing more than one term, terms should be
                            delimited by the query-delimiter character. By
                            default, no taxa will be excluded.         [optional]
     --p-query-delimiter TEXT
                            The string used to delimit multiple search terms
                            provided to include or exclude. This parameter should
                            only need to be modified if the default delimiter (a
                            comma) is used in the provided taxonomic annotations.
                                                                   [default: ',']
     --p-mode TEXT Choices('exact', 'contains')
                            Mode for determining if a search term matches a
                            taxonomic annotation. "contains" requires that the
                            annotation has the term as a substring; "exact"
                            requires that the annotation is a perfect match to a
                            search term.                    [default: 'contains']
   Outputs:
     --o-filtered-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                            The taxonomy-filtered feature table.       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH      Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                            during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                            execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations            Show citations and exit.
     --help                 Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Taxonomy-based feature table filter.

   This method filters features from a table based on their taxonomic
   annotations. Features can be retained in the resulting table by specifying
   one or more include search terms, and can be filtered out of the resulting
   table by specifying one or more exclude search terms. If both include and
   exclude are provided, the inclusion critera will be applied before the
   exclusion critera. Either include or exclude terms (or both) must be
   provided. Any samples that have a total frequency of zero after filtering
   will be removed from the resulting table.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       Feature table to be filtered.
   taxonomy : FeatureData[Taxonomy]
       Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided feature table. All
       features in the feature table must have a corresponding taxonomic
       annotation. Taxonomic annotations for features that are not present in
       the feature table will be ignored.
   include : Str, optional
       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa should be included in
       the resulting table. If providing more than one term, terms should be
       delimited by the query-delimiter character. By default, all taxa will
       be included.
   exclude : Str, optional
       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa should be excluded
       from the resulting table. If providing more than one term, terms should
       be delimited by the query-delimiter character. By default, no taxa will
       be excluded.
   query_delimiter : Str, optional
       The string used to delimit multiple search terms provided to include or
       exclude. This parameter should only need to be modified if the default
       delimiter (a comma) is used in the provided taxonomic annotations.
   mode : Str % Choices('exact', 'contains'), optional
       Mode for determining if a search term matches a taxonomic annotation.
       "contains" requires that the annotation has the term as a substring;
       "exact" requires that the annotation is a perfect match to a search
       term.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The taxonomy-filtered feature table.</pre>
