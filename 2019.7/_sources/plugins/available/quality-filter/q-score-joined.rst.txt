         <pre>Usage: qiime quality-filter q-score-joined [OPTIONS]

     This method filters joined sequence based on quality scores and the
     presence of ambiguous base calls.

   Inputs:
     --i-demux ARTIFACT SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
                          The demultiplexed sequence data to be quality
                          filtered.                                    [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-min-quality INTEGER
                          The minimum acceptable PHRED score. All PHRED scores
                          less that this value are considered to be low PHRED
                          scores.                                    [default: 4]
     --p-quality-window INTEGER
                          The maximum number of low PHRED scores that can be
                          observed in direct succession before truncating a
                          sequence read.                             [default: 3]
     --p-min-length-fraction NUMBER
                          The minimum length that a sequence read can be
                          following truncation and still be retained. This length
                          should be provided as a fraction of the input sequence
                          length.                                 [default: 0.75]
     --p-max-ambiguous INTEGER
                          The maximum number of ambiguous (i.e., N) base calls.
                          This is applied after trimming sequences based on
                          `min-length-fraction`.                     [default: 0]
   Outputs:
     --o-filtered-sequences ARTIFACT SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
                          The resulting quality-filtered sequences.    [required]
     --o-filter-stats ARTIFACT QualityFilterStats
                          Summary statistics of the filtering process. [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations          Show citations and exit.
     --help               Show this message and exit.</pre>

       <h4>Docstring:</h4>
         <pre>Quality filter based on joined sequence quality scores.

   This method filters joined sequence based on quality scores and the
   presence of ambiguous base calls.

   Parameters
   ----------
   demux : SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
       The demultiplexed sequence data to be quality filtered.
   min_quality : Int, optional
       The minimum acceptable PHRED score. All PHRED scores less that this
       value are considered to be low PHRED scores.
   quality_window : Int, optional
       The maximum number of low PHRED scores that can be observed in direct
       succession before truncating a sequence read.
   min_length_fraction : Float, optional
       The minimum length that a sequence read can be following truncation and
       still be retained. This length should be provided as a fraction of the
       input sequence length.
   max_ambiguous : Int, optional
       The maximum number of ambiguous (i.e., N) base calls. This is applied
       after trimming sequences based on `min_length_fraction`.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_sequences : SampleData[JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
       The resulting quality-filtered sequences.
   filter_stats : QualityFilterStats
       Summary statistics of the filtering process.</pre>
