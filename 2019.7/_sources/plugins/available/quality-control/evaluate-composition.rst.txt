     This visualizer compares the feature composition of pairs of observed and
     expected samples containing the same sample ID in two separate feature
     tables. Typically, feature composition will consist of taxonomy
     classifications or other semicolon-delimited feature annotations. Taxon
     accuracy rate, taxon detection rate, and linear regression scores between
     expected and observed observations are calculated at each semicolon-
     delimited rank, and plots of per-level accuracy and observation
     correlations are plotted. A histogram of distance between false positive
     observations and the nearest expected feature is also generated, where
     distance equals the number of rank differences between the observed
     feature and the nearest common lineage in the expected feature. This
     visualizer is most suitable for testing per-run data quality on sequencing
     runs that contain mock communities or other samples with known
     composition. Also suitable for sanity checks of bioinformatics pipeline
     performance.

         <pre>Evaluate expected vs. observed taxonomic composition of samples

   This visualizer compares the feature composition of pairs of observed and
   expected samples containing the same sample ID in two separate feature
   tables. Typically, feature composition will consist of taxonomy
   classifications or other semicolon-delimited feature annotations. Taxon
   accuracy rate, taxon detection rate, and linear regression scores between
   expected and observed observations are calculated at each semicolon-
   delimited rank, and plots of per-level accuracy and observation
   correlations are plotted. A histogram of distance between false positive
   observations and the nearest expected feature is also generated, where
   distance equals the number of rank differences between the observed feature
   and the nearest common lineage in the expected feature. This visualizer is
   most suitable for testing per-run data quality on sequencing runs that
   contain mock communities or other samples with known composition. Also
   suitable for sanity checks of bioinformatics pipeline performance.
