         <pre>Usage: qiime fragment-insertion filter-features [OPTIONS]

     Filters fragments not inserted into a phylogenetic tree from a feature-
     table. Some fragments computed by e.g. Deblur or DADA2 are too remote to
     get inserted by SEPP into a reference phylogeny. To be able to use the
     feature-table for downstream analyses like computing Faith's PD or
     UniFrac, the feature-table must be cleared of fragments that are not part
     of the phylogenetic tree, because their path length can otherwise not be
     determined. Typically, the number of rejected fragments is low (<= 10),
     but it might be worth to inspect the ratio of reads assigned to those
     rejected fragments.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          A feature-table which needs to filtered down to those
                          fragments that are contained in the tree, e.g. result
                          of a Deblur or DADA2 run.                    [required]
     --i-tree ARTIFACT    The tree resulting from inserting fragments into a
       Phylogeny[Rooted]  reference phylogeny, i.e. the output of function 'sepp'
                                                                       [required]
   Outputs:
     --o-filtered-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          The input table minus those fragments that were not
                          part of the tree. This feature-table can be used for
                          downstream analyses like phylogenetic alpha- or beta-
                          diversity computation.                       [required]
     --o-removed-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          Those fragments that got removed from the input table,
                          because they were not part of the tree. This table is
                          mainly used for quality control, e.g. to inspect the
                          ratio of removed reads per sample from the input table.
                          You can ignore this table for downstream analyses.
                                                                       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations          Show citations and exit.
     --help               Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Filter fragments in tree from table.

   Filters fragments not inserted into a phylogenetic tree from a feature-
   table. Some fragments computed by e.g. Deblur or DADA2 are too remote to
   get inserted by SEPP into a reference phylogeny. To be able to use the
   feature-table for downstream analyses like computing Faith's PD or UniFrac,

   it might be worth to inspect the ratio of reads assigned to those rejected
   fragments.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       A feature-table which needs to filtered down to those fragments that
       are contained in the tree, e.g. result of a Deblur or DADA2 run.
   tree : Phylogeny[Rooted]
       The tree resulting from inserting fragments into a reference phylogeny,
       i.e. the output of function 'sepp'

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The input table minus those fragments that were not part of the tree.
       This feature-table can be used for downstream analyses like
       phylogenetic alpha- or beta- diversity computation.
   removed_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       Those fragments that got removed from the input table, because they
       were not part of the tree. This table is mainly used for quality
       control, e.g. to inspect the ratio of removed reads per sample from the
       input table. You can ignore this table for downstream analyses.</pre>
