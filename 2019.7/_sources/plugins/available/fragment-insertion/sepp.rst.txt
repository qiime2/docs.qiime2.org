         <pre>Usage: qiime fragment-insertion sepp [OPTIONS]

     Perform fragment insertion of 16S sequences using the SEPP algorithm
     against the Greengenes 13_8 99% tree.

   Inputs:
     --i-representative-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                          The sequences to insert                      [required]
     --i-reference-alignment ARTIFACT FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
                          The reference multiple nucleotide alignment used to
                          construct the reference phylogeny.           [optional]
     --i-reference-phylogeny ARTIFACT
       Phylogeny[Rooted]  The rooted reference phylogeny. Must be in sync with
                          reference-alignment, i.e. each tip name must have
                          exactly one corresponding record.            [optional]
   Parameters:
     --p-threads INTEGER  The number of threads to use               [default: 1]
     --p-alignment-subset-size INTEGER
                          Each placement subset is further broken into subsets
                          of at most these many sequences and a separate HMM is
                          trained on each subset. The default alignment subset
                          size is set to balance the exhaustiveness of the
                          alignment step with the running time.   [default: 1000]
     --p-placement-subset-size INTEGER
                          The tree is divided into subsets such that each subset
                          includes at most these many subsets. The placement step
                          places the fragment on only one subset, determined
                          based on alignment scores. The default placement subset
                          is set to make sure the memory requirement of the
                          pplacer step does not become prohibitively
                          large.

     --p-debug / --p-no-debug
                          Print additional run information to STDOUT for
                          debugging. Run together with --verbose to actually see
                          the information on STDOUT. Temporary directories will
                          not be removed if run fails.           [default: False]
   Outputs:
     --o-tree ARTIFACT    The tree with inserted feature data

       Placements                                                      [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).

         <pre>Insert fragment sequences using SEPP into reference phylogenies like
   Greengenes 13_8

   Perform fragment insertion of 16S sequences using the SEPP algorithm
   against the Greengenes 13_8 99% tree.

   Parameters
   ----------
   representative_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences to insert
   threads : Int, optional
       The number of threads to use
   alignment_subset_size : Int, optional
       Each placement subset is further broken into subsets of at most these
       many sequences and a separate HMM is trained on each subset. The
       default alignment subset size is set to balance the exhaustiveness of
       the alignment step with the running time.
   placement_subset_size : Int, optional
       The tree is divided into subsets such that each subset includes at most
       these many subsets. The placement step places the fragment on only one
       subset, determined based on alignment scores. The default placement
       subset is set to make sure the memory requirement of the pplacer step
       does not become prohibitively large. Further reading:

       tutorial.md#sample-datasets-default-parameters
   reference_alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence], optional
       The reference multiple nucleotide alignment used to construct the
       reference phylogeny.
   reference_phylogeny : Phylogeny[Rooted], optional
       The rooted reference phylogeny. Must be in sync with reference-
       alignment, i.e. each tip name must have exactly one corresponding
       record.
   debug : Bool, optional
       Print additional run information to STDOUT for debugging. Run together
       with --verbose to actually see the information on STDOUT. Temporary
       directories will not be removed if run fails.

   Returns
   -------
   tree : Phylogeny[Rooted]
       The tree with inserted feature data
