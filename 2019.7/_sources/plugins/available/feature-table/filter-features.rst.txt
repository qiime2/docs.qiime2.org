         <pre>Usage: qiime feature-table filter-features [OPTIONS]

     Filter features from table based on frequency and/or metadata. Any samples
     with a frequency of zero after feature filtering will also be removed. See
     the filtering tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          The feature table from which features should be
                          filtered.                                    [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-min-frequency INTEGER
                          The minimum total frequency that a feature must have
                          to be retained.                            [default: 0]
     --p-max-frequency INTEGER
                          The maximum total frequency that a feature can have to
                          be retained. If no value is provided this will default
                          to infinity (i.e., no maximum frequency filter will be
                          applied).                                    [optional]
     --p-min-samples INTEGER
                          The minimum number of samples that a feature must be
                          observed in to be retained.                [default: 0]
     --p-max-samples INTEGER
                          The maximum number of samples that a feature can be
                          observed in to be retained. If no value is provided
                          this will default to infinity (i.e., no maximum sample
                          filter will be applied).                     [optional]
     --m-metadata-file METADATA...
       (multiple          Feature metadata used with `where` parameter when
        arguments will    selecting features to retain, or with `exclude-ids`
        be merged)        when selecting features to discard.          [optional]
     --p-where TEXT       SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature metadata
                          criteria that must be met to be included in the
                          filtered feature table. If not provided, all features
                          in `metadata` that are also in the feature table will
                          be retained.                                 [optional]
     --p-exclude-ids / --p-no-exclude-ids
                          If true, the features selected by `metadata` or
                          `where` parameters will be excluded from the filtered
                          table instead of being retained.       [default: False]
   Outputs:
     --o-filtered-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          The resulting feature table filtered by feature.
                                                                       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations          Show citations and exit.
     --help               Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Filter features from table

   Filter features from table based on frequency and/or metadata. Any samples
   with a frequency of zero after feature filtering will also be removed. See
   the filtering tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table from which features should be filtered.
   min_frequency : Int, optional
       The minimum total frequency that a feature must have to be retained.
   max_frequency : Int, optional
       The maximum total frequency that a feature can have to be retained. If
       no value is provided this will default to infinity (i.e., no maximum
       frequency filter will be applied).
   min_samples : Int, optional
       The minimum number of samples that a feature must be observed in to be
       retained.
   max_samples : Int, optional
       The maximum number of samples that a feature can be observed in to be
       retained. If no value is provided this will default to infinity (i.e.,
       no maximum sample filter will be applied).
   metadata : Metadata, optional
       Feature metadata used with `where` parameter when selecting features to
       retain, or with `exclude_ids` when selecting features to discard.
   where : Str, optional
       SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature metadata criteria that must be
       met to be included in the filtered feature table. If not provided, all
       features in `metadata` that are also in the feature table will be
       retained.
   exclude_ids : Bool, optional
       If true, the features selected by `metadata` or `where` parameters will
       be excluded from the filtered table instead of being retained.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The resulting feature table filtered by feature.</pre>
