         <pre>Usage: qiime quality-control evaluate-taxonomy [OPTIONS]

     This visualizer compares a pair of observed and expected taxonomic
     assignments to calculate precision, recall, and F-measure at each
     taxonomic level, up to maximum level specified by the depth parameter.
     These metrics are calculated at each semicolon-delimited rank. This action
     is useful for comparing the accuracy of taxonomic assignment, e.g.,
     between different taxonomy classifiers or other bioinformatics methods.
     Expected taxonomies should be derived from simulated or mock community
     sequences that have known taxonomic affiliations.

   Inputs:
     --i-expected-taxa ARTIFACT FeatureData[Taxonomy]
                          Expected taxonomic assignments               [required]

     --i-feature-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[RelativeFrequency]
                          Optional feature table containing relative frequency
                          of each feature, used to weight accuracy scores by
                          frequency. Must contain all features found in expected
                          and/or observed taxa. Features found in the table but
                          not the expected/observed taxa will be dropped prior to
                          analysis.                                    [optional]
   Parameters:
     --p-depth INTEGER    Maximum depth of semicolon-delimited taxonomic ranks
                          to test (e.g., 1 = root, 7 = species for the greengenes
                          reference sequence database).                [required]

     --p-require-exp-ids / --p-no-require-exp-ids
                          Require that all features found in observed taxa must
                          be found in expected taxa or raise error.
                                                                  [default: True]
     --p-require-obs-ids / --p-no-require-obs-ids
                          Require that all features found in expected taxa must
                          be found in observed taxa or raise error.
                                                                  [default: True]
     --p-sample-id TEXT   Optional sample ID to use for extracting frequency
                          data from feature table, and for labeling accuracy
                          results. If no sample-id is provided, feature
                          frequencies are derived from the sum of all samples
                          present in the feature table.                [optional]

     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).

         <pre>Evaluate expected vs. observed taxonomic assignments

   This visualizer compares a pair of observed and expected taxonomic
   assignments to calculate precision, recall, and F-measure at each taxonomic
   level, up to maximum level specified by the depth parameter. These metrics
   are calculated at each semicolon-delimited rank. This action is useful for
   comparing the accuracy of taxonomic assignment, e.g., between different
   taxonomy classifiers or other bioinformatics methods. Expected taxonomies
   should be derived from simulated or mock community sequences that have
   known taxonomic affiliations.

       Expected taxonomic assignments
   observed_taxa : FeatureData[Taxonomy]

   depth : Int
       Maximum depth of semicolon-delimited taxonomic ranks to test (e.g., 1 =
       root, 7 = species for the greengenes reference sequence database).

       Color palette to utilize for plotting.
   require_exp_ids : Bool, optional
       Require that all features found in observed taxa must be found in
       expected taxa or raise error.

       Require that all features found in expected taxa must be found in
       observed taxa or raise error.
   feature_table : FeatureTable[RelativeFrequency], optional
       Optional feature table containing relative frequency of each feature,

       found in expected and/or observed taxa. Features found in the table but

   sample_id : Str, optional
       Optional sample ID to use for extracting frequency data from feature
       table, and for labeling accuracy results. If no sample_id is provided,
       feature frequencies are derived from the sum of all samples present in
