         <pre>Usage: qiime feature-table filter-samples [OPTIONS]

     Filter samples from table based on frequency and/or metadata. Any features
     with a frequency of zero after sample filtering will also be removed. See
     the filtering tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency¹ | RelativeFrequency² |
       PresenceAbsence³ | Composition⁴]
                          The feature table from which samples should be
                          filtered.                                    [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-min-frequency INTEGER
                          The minimum total frequency that a sample must have to
                          be retained.                               [default: 0]
     --p-max-frequency INTEGER
                          The maximum total frequency that a sample can have to
                          be retained. If no value is provided this will default
                          to infinity (i.e., no maximum frequency filter will be
                          applied).                                    [optional]
     --p-min-features INTEGER
                          The minimum number of features that a sample must have
                          to be retained.                            [default: 0]
     --p-max-features INTEGER
                          The maximum number of features that a sample can have
                          to be retained. If no value is provided this will
                          default to infinity (i.e., no maximum feature filter
                          will be applied).                            [optional]
     --m-metadata-file METADATA...
       (multiple          Sample metadata used with `where` parameter when
        arguments will    selecting samples to retain, or with `exclude-ids` when
        be merged)        selecting samples to discard.                [optional]
     --p-where TEXT       SQLite WHERE clause specifying sample metadata
                          criteria that must be met to be included in the
                          filtered feature table. If not provided, all samples in
                          `metadata` that are also in the feature table will be
                          retained.                                    [optional]
     --p-exclude-ids / --p-no-exclude-ids
                          If true, the samples selected by `metadata` or `where`
                          parameters will be excluded from the filtered table
                          instead of being retained.             [default: False]
   Outputs:
     --o-filtered-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency¹ | RelativeFrequency²
       | PresenceAbsence³ | Composition⁴]
                          The resulting feature table filtered by sample.
                                                                       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations          Show citations and exit.
     --help               Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Filter samples from table

   Filter samples from table based on frequency and/or metadata. Any features
   with a frequency of zero after sample filtering will also be removed. See
   the filtering tutorial on https://docs.qiime2.org for additional details.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency¹ | RelativeFrequency² | PresenceAbsence³ | Composition⁴]
       The feature table from which samples should be filtered.
   min_frequency : Int, optional
       The minimum total frequency that a sample must have to be retained.
   max_frequency : Int, optional
       The maximum total frequency that a sample can have to be retained. If
       no value is provided this will default to infinity (i.e., no maximum
       frequency filter will be applied).
   min_features : Int, optional
       The minimum number of features that a sample must have to be retained.
   max_features : Int, optional
       The maximum number of features that a sample can have to be retained.
       If no value is provided this will default to infinity (i.e., no maximum
       feature filter will be applied).
   metadata : Metadata, optional
       Sample metadata used with `where` parameter when selecting samples to
       retain, or with `exclude_ids` when selecting samples to discard.
   where : Str, optional
       SQLite WHERE clause specifying sample metadata criteria that must be
       met to be included in the filtered feature table. If not provided, all
       samples in `metadata` that are also in the feature table will be
       retained.
   exclude_ids : Bool, optional
       If true, the samples selected by `metadata` or `where` parameters will
       be excluded from the filtered table instead of being retained.

   Returns
   -------
   filtered_table : FeatureTable[Frequency¹ | RelativeFrequency² | PresenceAbsence³ | Composition⁴]
       The resulting feature table filtered by sample.</pre>
