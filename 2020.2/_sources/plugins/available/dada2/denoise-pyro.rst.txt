     This method denoises single-end pyrosequencing sequences, dereplicates
     them, and filters chimeras.

   Inputs:
     --i-demultiplexed-seqs ARTIFACT SampleData[SequencesWithQuality]
                            The single-end demultiplexed pyrosequencing
                            sequences (e.g. 454, IonTorrent) to be denoised.
                                                                       [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-trunc-len INTEGER  Position at which sequences should be truncated due
                            to decrease in quality. This truncates the 3' end of
                            the of the input sequences, which will be the bases
                            that were sequenced in the last cycles. Reads that
                            are shorter than this value will be discarded. If 0
                            is provided, no truncation or length filtering will
                            be performed                               [required]
     --p-trim-left INTEGER  Position at which sequences should be trimmed due to
                            low quality. This trims the 5' end of the of the
                            input sequences, which will be the bases that were
                            sequenced in the first cycles.           [default: 0]
     --p-max-ee NUMBER      Reads with number of expected errors higher than
                            this value will be discarded.          [default: 2.0]
     --p-trunc-q INTEGER    Reads are truncated at the first instance of a
                            quality score less than or equal to this value. If
                            the resulting read is then shorter than `trunc-len`,
                            it is discarded.                         [default: 2]
     --p-max-len INTEGER    Remove reads prior to trimming or truncation which
                            are longer than this value. If 0 is provided no reads
                            will be removed based on length.         [default: 0]
     --p-chimera-method TEXT Choices('consensus', 'none', 'pooled')
                            The method used to remove chimeras. "none": No
                            chimera removal is performed. "pooled": All reads are
                            pooled prior to chimera detection. "consensus":
                            Chimeras are detected in samples individually, and
                            sequences found chimeric in a sufficient fraction of
                            samples are removed.           [default: 'consensus']
     --p-min-fold-parent-over-abundance NUMBER
                            The minimum abundance of potential parents of a
                            sequence being tested as chimeric, expressed as a
                            fold-change versus the abundance of the sequence
                            being tested. Values should be greater than or equal
                            to 1 (i.e. parents should be more abundant than the
                            sequence being tested). This parameter has no effect
                            if chimera-method is "none".           [default: 1.0]
     --p-n-threads INTEGER  The number of threads to use for multithreaded
                            processing. If 0 is provided, all available cores
                            will be used.                            [default: 1]
     --p-n-reads-learn INTEGER
                            The number of reads to use when training the error
                            model. Smaller numbers will result in a shorter run
                            time but a less reliable error model.
                                                                [default: 250000]
     --p-hashed-feature-ids / --p-no-hashed-feature-ids
                            If true, the feature ids in the resulting table will
                            be presented as hashes of the sequences defining each
                            feature. The hash will always be the same for the
                            same sequence so this allows feature tables to be
                            merged across runs of this method. You should only
                            merge tables if the exact same parameters are used
                            for each run.                         [default: True]
   Outputs:
     --o-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                            The resulting feature table.               [required]
     --o-representative-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                            The resulting feature sequences. Each feature in the
                            feature table will be represented by exactly one
                            sequence.                                  [required]
     --o-denoising-stats ARTIFACT SampleData[DADA2Stats]
                                                                       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH      Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                            during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                            execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations            Show citations and exit.
     --help                 Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Denoise and dereplicate single-end pyrosequences

   This method denoises single-end pyrosequencing sequences, dereplicates
   them, and filters chimeras.

   Parameters
   ----------
   demultiplexed_seqs : SampleData[SequencesWithQuality]
       The single-end demultiplexed pyrosequencing sequences (e.g. 454,
       IonTorrent) to be denoised.
   trunc_len : Int
       Position at which sequences should be truncated due to decrease in
       quality. This truncates the 3' end of the of the input sequences, which
       will be the bases that were sequenced in the last cycles. Reads that
       are shorter than this value will be discarded. If 0 is provided, no
       truncation or length filtering will be performed
   trim_left : Int, optional
       Position at which sequences should be trimmed due to low quality. This
       trims the 5' end of the of the input sequences, which will be the bases
       that were sequenced in the first cycles.
   max_ee : Float, optional
       Reads with number of expected errors higher than this value will be
       discarded.
   trunc_q : Int, optional
       Reads are truncated at the first instance of a quality score less than
       or equal to this value. If the resulting read is then shorter than
       `trunc_len`, it is discarded.
   max_len : Int, optional
       Remove reads prior to trimming or truncation which are longer than this
       value. If 0 is provided no reads will be removed based on length.
   chimera_method : Str % Choices('pooled', 'none', 'consensus'), optional
       The method used to remove chimeras. "none": No chimera removal is
       performed. "pooled": All reads are pooled prior to chimera detection.
       "consensus": Chimeras are detected in samples individually, and
       sequences found chimeric in a sufficient fraction of samples are
       removed.
   min_fold_parent_over_abundance : Float, optional
       The minimum abundance of potential parents of a sequence being tested
       as chimeric, expressed as a fold-change versus the abundance of the
       sequence being tested. Values should be greater than or equal to 1
       (i.e. parents should be more abundant than the sequence being tested).
       This parameter has no effect if chimera_method is "none".
   n_threads : Int, optional
       The number of threads to use for multithreaded processing. If 0 is
       provided, all available cores will be used.
   n_reads_learn : Int, optional
       The number of reads to use when training the error model. Smaller
       numbers will result in a shorter run time but a less reliable error
       model.
   hashed_feature_ids : Bool, optional
       If true, the feature ids in the resulting table will be presented as
       hashes of the sequences defining each feature. The hash will always be
       the same for the same sequence so this allows feature tables to be
       merged across runs of this method. You should only merge tables if the
       exact same parameters are used for each run.

   Returns
   -------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The resulting feature table.
   representative_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The resulting feature sequences. Each feature in the feature table will
       be represented by exactly one sequence.
   denoising_stats : SampleData[DADA2Stats]</pre>
