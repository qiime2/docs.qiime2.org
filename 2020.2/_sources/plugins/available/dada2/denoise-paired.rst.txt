         <pre>Usage: qiime dada2 denoise-paired [OPTIONS]

     This method denoises paired-end sequences, dereplicates them, and filters
     chimeras.

   Inputs:
     --i-demultiplexed-seqs ARTIFACT SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]
                            The paired-end demultiplexed sequences to be
                            denoised.                                  [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-trunc-len-f INTEGER
                            Position at which forward read sequences should be
                            truncated due to decrease in quality. This truncates
                            the 3' end of the of the input sequences, which will
                            be the bases that were sequenced in the last cycles.
                            Reads that are shorter than this value will be
                            discarded. After this parameter is applied there must
                            still be at least a 12 nucleotide overlap between the
                            forward and reverse reads. If 0 is provided, no
                            truncation or length filtering will be performed
                                                                       [required]
     --p-trunc-len-r INTEGER
                            Position at which reverse read sequences should be
                            truncated due to decrease in quality. This truncates
                            the 3' end of the of the input sequences, which will
                            be the bases that were sequenced in the last cycles.
                            Reads that are shorter than this value will be
                            discarded. After this parameter is applied there must
                            still be at least a 12 nucleotide overlap between the
                            forward and reverse reads. If 0 is provided, no
                            truncation or length filtering will be performed
                                                                       [required]
     --p-trim-left-f INTEGER
                            Position at which forward read sequences should be
                            trimmed due to low quality. This trims the 5' end of
                            the input sequences, which will be the bases that
                            were sequenced in the first cycles.      [default: 0]
     --p-trim-left-r INTEGER
                            Position at which reverse read sequences should be
                            trimmed due to low quality. This trims the 5' end of
                            the input sequences, which will be the bases that
                            were sequenced in the first cycles.      [default: 0]
     --p-max-ee-f NUMBER    Forward reads with number of expected errors higher
                            than this value will be discarded.     [default: 2.0]
     --p-max-ee-r NUMBER    Reverse reads with number of expected errors higher
                            than this value will be discarded.     [default: 2.0]
     --p-trunc-q INTEGER    Reads are truncated at the first instance of a
                            quality score less than or equal to this value. If
                            the resulting read is then shorter than `trunc-len-f`
                            or `trunc-len-r` (depending on the direction of the
                            read) it is discarded.                   [default: 2]
     --p-chimera-method TEXT Choices('consensus', 'none', 'pooled')
                            The method used to remove chimeras. "none": No
                            chimera removal is performed. "pooled": All reads are
                            pooled prior to chimera detection. "consensus":
                            Chimeras are detected in samples individually, and
                            sequences found chimeric in a sufficient fraction of
                            samples are removed.           [default: 'consensus']
     --p-min-fold-parent-over-abundance NUMBER
                            The minimum abundance of potential parents of a
                            sequence being tested as chimeric, expressed as a
                            fold-change versus the abundance of the sequence
                            being tested. Values should be greater than or equal
                            to 1 (i.e. parents should be more abundant than the
                            sequence being tested). This parameter has no effect
                            if chimera-method is "none".           [default: 1.0]
     --p-n-threads INTEGER  The number of threads to use for multithreaded
                            processing. If 0 is provided, all available cores
                            will be used.                            [default: 1]
     --p-n-reads-learn INTEGER
                            The number of reads to use when training the error
                            model. Smaller numbers will result in a shorter run
                            time but a less reliable error model.
                                                               [default: 1000000]
     --p-hashed-feature-ids / --p-no-hashed-feature-ids
                            If true, the feature ids in the resulting table will
                            be presented as hashes of the sequences defining each
                            feature. The hash will always be the same for the
                            same sequence so this allows feature tables to be
                            merged across runs of this method. You should only
                            merge tables if the exact same parameters are used
                            for each run.                         [default: True]
   Outputs:
     --o-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                            The resulting feature table.               [required]
     --o-representative-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                            The resulting feature sequences. Each feature in the
                            feature table will be represented by exactly one
                            sequence, and these sequences will be the joined
                            paired-end sequences.                      [required]
     --o-denoising-stats ARTIFACT SampleData[DADA2Stats]
                                                                       [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH      Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                            during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                            execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations            Show citations and exit.

         <pre>Denoise and dereplicate paired-end sequences

   This method denoises paired-end sequences, dereplicates them, and filters
   chimeras.

   Parameters
   ----------
   demultiplexed_seqs : SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]
       The paired-end demultiplexed sequences to be denoised.
   trunc_len_f : Int
       Position at which forward read sequences should be truncated due to
       decrease in quality. This truncates the 3' end of the of the input
       sequences, which will be the bases that were sequenced in the last
       cycles. Reads that are shorter than this value will be discarded. After
       this parameter is applied there must still be at least a 12 nucleotide
       overlap between the forward and reverse reads. If 0 is provided, no
       truncation or length filtering will be performed
   trunc_len_r : Int
       Position at which reverse read sequences should be truncated due to
       decrease in quality. This truncates the 3' end of the of the input
       sequences, which will be the bases that were sequenced in the last
       cycles. Reads that are shorter than this value will be discarded. After
       this parameter is applied there must still be at least a 12 nucleotide
       overlap between the forward and reverse reads. If 0 is provided, no
       truncation or length filtering will be performed
   trim_left_f : Int, optional
       Position at which forward read sequences should be trimmed due to low
       quality. This trims the 5' end of the input sequences, which will be
       the bases that were sequenced in the first cycles.
   trim_left_r : Int, optional
       Position at which reverse read sequences should be trimmed due to low
       quality. This trims the 5' end of the input sequences, which will be
       the bases that were sequenced in the first cycles.
   max_ee_f : Float, optional
       Forward reads with number of expected errors higher than this value
       will be discarded.
   max_ee_r : Float, optional
       Reverse reads with number of expected errors higher than this value
       will be discarded.
   trunc_q : Int, optional
       Reads are truncated at the first instance of a quality score less than
       or equal to this value. If the resulting read is then shorter than
       `trunc_len_f` or `trunc_len_r` (depending on the direction of the read)
       it is discarded.
   chimera_method : Str % Choices('pooled', 'none', 'consensus'), optional
       The method used to remove chimeras. "none": No chimera removal is
       performed. "pooled": All reads are pooled prior to chimera detection.
       "consensus": Chimeras are detected in samples individually, and
       sequences found chimeric in a sufficient fraction of samples are
       removed.
   min_fold_parent_over_abundance : Float, optional
       The minimum abundance of potential parents of a sequence being tested
       as chimeric, expressed as a fold-change versus the abundance of the
       sequence being tested. Values should be greater than or equal to 1
       (i.e. parents should be more abundant than the sequence being tested).
       This parameter has no effect if chimera_method is "none".
   n_threads : Int, optional
       The number of threads to use for multithreaded processing. If 0 is
       provided, all available cores will be used.
   n_reads_learn : Int, optional
       The number of reads to use when training the error model. Smaller
       numbers will result in a shorter run time but a less reliable error
       model.
   hashed_feature_ids : Bool, optional
       If true, the feature ids in the resulting table will be presented as
       hashes of the sequences defining each feature. The hash will always be
       the same for the same sequence so this allows feature tables to be
       merged across runs of this method. You should only merge tables if the
       exact same parameters are used for each run.

   Returns
   -------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The resulting feature table.
   representative_sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The resulting feature sequences. Each feature in the feature table will
       be represented by exactly one sequence, and these sequences will be the
       joined paired-end sequences.
   denoising_stats : SampleData[DADA2Stats]</pre>
