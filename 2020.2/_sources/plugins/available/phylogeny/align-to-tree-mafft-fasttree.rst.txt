         <pre>Usage: qiime phylogeny align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree [OPTIONS]

     This pipeline will start by creating a sequence alignment using MAFFT,
     after which any alignment columns that are phylogenetically uninformative
     or ambiguously aligned will be removed (masked). The resulting masked
     alignment will be used to infer a phylogenetic tree and then subsequently
     rooted at its midpoint. Output files from each step of the pipeline will
     be saved. This includes both the unmasked and masked MAFFT alignment from
     q2-alignment methods, and both the rooted and unrooted phylogenies from
     q2-phylogeny methods.

   Inputs:
     --i-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             The sequences to be used for creating a fasttree
                             based rooted phylogenetic tree.           [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-n-threads VALUE Int % Range(1, None) | Str % Choices('auto')
                             The number of threads. (Use `auto` to automatically
                             use all available cores) This value is used when
                             aligning the sequences and creating the tree with
                             fasttree.                               [default: 1]
     --p-mask-max-gap-frequency PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True)
                             The maximum relative frequency of gap characters in
                             a column for the column to be retained. This
                             relative frequency must be a number between 0.0 and
                             1.0 (inclusive), where 0.0 retains only those
                             columns without gap characters, and 1.0 retains all
                             columns  regardless of gap character frequency. This
                             value is used when masking the aligned sequences.
                                                                   [default: 1.0]
     --p-mask-min-conservation PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True)
                             The minimum relative frequency of at least one
                             non-gap character in a column for that column to be
                             retained. This relative frequency must be a number
                             between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a
                             value of  0.4 is provided, a column will only be
                             retained  if it contains at least one character that
                             is present in at least 40% of the sequences. This
                             value is used when masking the aligned sequences.
                                                                   [default: 0.4]
     --p-parttree / --p-no-parttree
                             This flag is required if the number of sequences
                             being aligned are larger than 1000000. Disabled by
                             default.                            [default: False]
   Outputs:
     --o-alignment ARTIFACT FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
                             The aligned sequences.                    [required]
     --o-masked-alignment ARTIFACT FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
                             The masked alignment.                     [required]
     --o-tree ARTIFACT       The unrooted phylogenetic tree.
       Phylogeny[Unrooted]                                             [required]
     --o-rooted-tree ARTIFACT
       Phylogeny[Rooted]     The rooted phylogenetic tree.             [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                             during execution of this action. Or silence output
                             if execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations             Show citations and exit.

         <pre>Build a phylogenetic tree using fasttree and mafft alignment

   This pipeline will start by creating a sequence alignment using MAFFT,
   after which any alignment columns that are phylogenetically uninformative
   or ambiguously aligned will be removed (masked). The resulting masked
   alignment will be used to infer a phylogenetic tree and then subsequently
   rooted at its midpoint. Output files from each step of the pipeline will be
   saved. This includes both the unmasked and masked MAFFT alignment from
   q2-alignment methods, and both the rooted and unrooted phylogenies from
   q2-phylogeny methods.

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences to be used for creating a fasttree based rooted
       phylogenetic tree.
   n_threads : Int % Range(1, None) | Str % Choices('auto'), optional
       The number of threads. (Use `auto` to automatically use all available
       cores) This value is used when aligning the sequences and creating the
       tree with fasttree.
   mask_max_gap_frequency : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The maximum relative frequency of gap characters in a column for the
       column to be retained. This relative frequency must be a number between
       0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive), where 0.0 retains only those columns without
       gap characters, and 1.0 retains all columns  regardless of gap
       character frequency. This value is used when masking the aligned
       sequences.
   mask_min_conservation : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The minimum relative frequency of at least one non-gap character in a
       column for that column to be retained. This relative frequency must be
       a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a value of
       0.4 is provided, a column will only be retained  if it contains at
       least one character that is present in at least 40% of the sequences.
       This value is used when masking the aligned sequences.
   parttree : Bool, optional
       This flag is required if the number of sequences being aligned are
       larger than 1000000. Disabled by default.

   Returns
   -------
   alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
       The aligned sequences.
   masked_alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
       The masked alignment.
   tree : Phylogeny[Unrooted]
       The unrooted phylogenetic tree.
   rooted_tree : Phylogeny[Rooted]
       The rooted phylogenetic tree.</pre>
