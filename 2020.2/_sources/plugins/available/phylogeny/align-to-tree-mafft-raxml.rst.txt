         <pre>Usage: qiime phylogeny align-to-tree-mafft-raxml [OPTIONS]

     This pipeline will start by creating a sequence alignment using MAFFT,
     after which any alignment columns that are phylogenetically uninformative
     or ambiguously aligned will be removed (masked). The resulting masked
     alignment will be used to infer a phylogenetic tree using RAxML, under the
     specified substitution model, and then subsequently rooted at its
     midpoint. Output files from each step of the pipeline will be saved. This
     includes both the unmasked and masked MAFFT alignment from q2-alignment
     methods, and both the rooted and unrooted phylogenies from q2-phylogeny
     methods.

   Inputs:
     --i-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                             The sequences to be used for creating a iqtree
                             based rooted phylogenetic tree.           [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-n-threads VALUE Int % Range(1, None) | Str % Choices('auto')
                             The number of threads. (Use `all` to automatically
                             use all available cores. This value is used when
                             aligning the sequences and creating the tree with
                             iqtree.                                 [default: 1]
     --p-mask-max-gap-frequency PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True)
                             The maximum relative frequency of gap characters in
                             a column for the column to be retained. This
                             relative frequency must be a number between 0.0 and
                             1.0 (inclusive), where 0.0 retains only those
                             columns without gap characters, and 1.0 retains all
                             columns  regardless of gap character frequency. This
                             value is used when masking the aligned sequences.
                                                                   [default: 1.0]
     --p-mask-min-conservation PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True)
                             The minimum relative frequency of at least one
                             non-gap character in a column for that column to be
                             retained. This relative frequency must be a number
                             between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a
                             value of  0.4 is provided, a column will only be
                             retained  if it contains at least one character that
                             is present in at least 40% of the sequences. This
                             value is used when masking the aligned sequences.
                                                                   [default: 0.4]
     --p-parttree / --p-no-parttree
                             This flag is required if the number of sequences
                             being aligned are larger than 1000000. Disabled by
                             default. NOTE: if using this option, it is
                             recomended that only the CAT-based substitution
                             models of RAxML be considered for this pipeline.
                                                                 [default: False]
     --p-substitution-model TEXT Choices('GTRGAMMA', 'GTRGAMMAI', 'GTRCAT',
       'GTRCATI')            Model of Nucleotide Substitution.
                                                            [default: 'GTRGAMMA']
     --p-seed INTEGER        Random number seed for the parsimony starting tree.
                             This allows you to reproduce tree results. If not
                             supplied then one will be randomly chosen.
                                                                       [optional]
     --p-raxml-version TEXT Choices('Standard', 'SSE3', 'AVX2')
                             Select a specific CPU optimization of RAxML to use.
                             The SSE3 versions will run approximately 40% faster
                             than the standard version. The AVX2 version will run
                             10-30% faster than the SSE3 version.
                                                            [default: 'Standard']
   Outputs:
     --o-alignment ARTIFACT FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
                             The aligned sequences.                    [required]
     --o-masked-alignment ARTIFACT FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
                             The masked alignment.                     [required]

   or ambiguously aligned will be removed (masked). The resulting masked
   alignment will be used to infer a phylogenetic tree using RAxML, under the

   Parameters
   ----------
   sequences : FeatureData[Sequence]
       The sequences to be used for creating a iqtree based rooted
       phylogenetic tree.
   n_threads : Int % Range(1, None) | Str % Choices('auto'), optional
       The number of threads. (Use `all` to automatically use all available
       cores. This value is used when aligning the sequences and creating the
       tree with iqtree.
   mask_max_gap_frequency : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The maximum relative frequency of gap characters in a column for the
       column to be retained. This relative frequency must be a number between
       0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive), where 0.0 retains only those columns without
       gap characters, and 1.0 retains all columns  regardless of gap
       character frequency. This value is used when masking the aligned
       sequences.
   mask_min_conservation : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The minimum relative frequency of at least one non-gap character in a
       column for that column to be retained. This relative frequency must be
       a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a value of
       0.4 is provided, a column will only be retained  if it contains at
       least one character that is present in at least 40% of the sequences.
       This value is used when masking the aligned sequences.
   parttree : Bool, optional
       This flag is required if the number of sequences being aligned are
       larger than 1000000. Disabled by default. NOTE: if using this option,
       it is recomended that only the CAT-based substitution models of RAxML
       be considered for this pipeline.
   substitution_model : Str % Choices('GTRGAMMA', 'GTRGAMMAI', 'GTRCAT', 'GTRCATI'), optional
       Model of Nucleotide Substitution.
   seed : Int, optional
       Random number seed for the parsimony starting tree. This allows you to
       reproduce tree results. If not supplied then one will be randomly
       chosen.
   raxml_version : Str % Choices('Standard', 'SSE3', 'AVX2'), optional
       Select a specific CPU optimization of RAxML to use. The SSE3 versions
       will run approximately 40% faster than the standard version. The AVX2
       version will run 10-30% faster than the SSE3 version.
