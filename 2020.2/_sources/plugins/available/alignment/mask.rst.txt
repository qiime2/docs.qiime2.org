         <pre>Usage: qiime alignment mask [OPTIONS]

     Mask (i.e., filter) unconserved and highly gapped columns from an
     alignment. Default min_conservation was chosen to reproduce the mask
     presented in Lane (1991).

   Inputs:
     --i-alignment ARTIFACT FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
                             The alignment to be masked.               [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-max-gap-frequency PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True)
                             The maximum relative frequency of gap characters in
                             a column for the column to be retained. This
                             relative frequency must be a number between 0.0 and
                             1.0 (inclusive), where 0.0 retains only those
                             columns without gap characters, and 1.0 retains all
                             columns regardless of gap character frequency.
                                                                   [default: 1.0]
     --p-min-conservation PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True)
                             The minimum relative frequency of at least one
                             non-gap character in a column for that column to be
                             retained. This relative frequency must be a number
                             between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a
                             value of 0.4 is provided, a column will only be
                             retained if it contains at least one character that
                             is present in at least 40% of the sequences.
                                                                   [default: 0.4]
   Outputs:
     --o-masked-alignment ARTIFACT FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
                             The masked alignment.                     [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                             during execution of this action. Or silence output
                             if execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations             Show citations and exit.
     --help                  Show this message and exit.</pre>

       <h4>Docstring:</h4>
         <pre>Positional conservation and gap filtering.

   Mask (i.e., filter) unconserved and highly gapped columns from an
   alignment. Default min_conservation was chosen to reproduce the mask
   presented in Lane (1991).

   Parameters
   ----------
   alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
       The alignment to be masked.
   max_gap_frequency : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The maximum relative frequency of gap characters in a column for the
       column to be retained. This relative frequency must be a number between
       0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive), where 0.0 retains only those columns without
       gap characters, and 1.0 retains all columns regardless of gap character
       frequency.
   min_conservation : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
       The minimum relative frequency of at least one non-gap character in a
       column for that column to be retained. This relative frequency must be
       a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a value of
       0.4 is provided, a column will only be retained if it contains at least
       one character that is present in at least 40% of the sequences.

   Returns
   -------
   masked_alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
       The masked alignment.</pre>
