         <pre>Usage: qiime diversity adonis [OPTIONS]

     Determine whether groups of samples are significantly different from one
     another using the ADONIS permutation-based statistical test in vegan-R.
     The function partitions sums of squares of a multivariate data set, and is
     directly analogous to MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance). This
     action differs from beta_group_significance in that it accepts R formulae
     to perform multi-way ADONIS tests; beta_group_signficance only performs
     one-way tests. For more details see
     http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/softhelp/vegan/html/adonis.html

   Inputs:
     --i-distance-matrix ARTIFACT
       DistanceMatrix     Matrix of distances between pairs of samples.
                                                                       [required]
   Parameters:
     --m-metadata-file METADATA...
       (multiple          Sample metadata containing formula terms.
        arguments will    
        be merged)                                                     [required]
     --p-formula TEXT     Model formula containing only independent terms
                          contained in the sample metadata. These can be
                          continuous variables or factors, and they can have
                          interactions as in a typical R formula. E.g., the
                          formula "treatment+block" would test whether the input
                          distance matrix partitions based on "treatment" and
                          "block" sample metadata. The formula "treatment*block"
                          would test both of those effects as well as their
                          interaction. Enclose formulae in quotes to avoid
                          unpleasant surprises.                        [required]
     --p-permutations INTEGER
       Range(1, None)     The number of permutations to be run when computing
                          p-values.                                [default: 999]
     --p-n-jobs INTEGER   Number of parallel processes to run.
       Range(1, None)                                                [default: 1]

   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).

   Parameters
   ----------
   distance_matrix : DistanceMatrix
       Matrix of distances between pairs of samples.
   metadata : Metadata
       Sample metadata containing formula terms.
   formula : Str
       Model formula containing only independent terms contained in the sample
       metadata. These can be continuous variables or factors, and they can
       have interactions as in a typical R formula. E.g., the formula
       "treatment+block" would test whether the input distance matrix
       partitions based on "treatment" and "block" sample metadata. The
       formula "treatment*block" would test both of those effects as well as
       their interaction. Enclose formulae in quotes to avoid unpleasant
       surprises.
   permutations : Int % Range(1, None), optional
       The number of permutations to be run when computing p-values.
   n_jobs : Int % Range(1, None), optional
       Number of parallel processes to run.
