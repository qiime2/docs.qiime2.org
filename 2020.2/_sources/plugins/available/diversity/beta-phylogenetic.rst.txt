         <pre>Usage: qiime diversity beta-phylogenetic [OPTIONS]

     Computes a user-specified phylogenetic beta diversity metric for all pairs
     of samples in a feature table.

   Inputs:
     --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                             The feature table containing the samples over which
                             beta diversity should be computed.        [required]
     --i-phylogeny ARTIFACT  Phylogenetic tree containing tip identifiers that
       Phylogeny[Rooted]     correspond to the feature identifiers in the table.
                             This tree can contain tip ids that are not present
                             in the table, but all feature ids in the table must
                             be present in this tree.                  [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-metric TEXT Choices('weighted_unifrac', 'unweighted_unifrac',
       'generalized_unifrac', 'weighted_normalized_unifrac')
                             The beta diversity metric to be computed. [required]
     --p-n-jobs INTEGER      The number of workers to use.           [default: 1]
     --p-variance-adjusted / --p-no-variance-adjusted
                             Perform variance adjustment based on Chang et al.
                             BMC Bioinformatics 2011. Weights distances based on
                             the proportion of the relative abundance represented
                             between the samples at a given node under
                             evaluation.                         [default: False]
     --p-alpha PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True)
                             This parameter is only used when the choice of
                             metric is generalized_unifrac. The value of alpha
                             controls importance of sample proportions. 1.0 is
                             weighted normalized UniFrac. 0.0 is close to
                             unweighted UniFrac, but only if the sample
                             proportions are dichotomized.             [optional]
     --p-bypass-tips / --p-no-bypass-tips
                             In a bifurcating tree, the tips make up about 50%
                             of the nodes in a tree. By ignoring them,
                             specificity can be traded for reduced compute time.
                             This has the effect of collapsing the phylogeny, and
                             is analogous (in concept) to moving from 99% to 97%
                             OTUs                                [default: False]
   Outputs:
     --o-distance-matrix ARTIFACT DistanceMatrix % Properties('phylogenetic')
                             The resulting distance matrix.            [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                             during execution of this action. Or silence output
                             if execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --citations             Show citations and exit.
     --help                  Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>Beta diversity (phylogenetic)

   Computes a user-specified phylogenetic beta diversity metric for all pairs
   of samples in a feature table.

   Parameters
   ----------
   table : FeatureTable[Frequency]
       The feature table containing the samples over which beta diversity
       should be computed.
   phylogeny : Phylogeny[Rooted]
       Phylogenetic tree containing tip identifiers that correspond to the
       feature identifiers in the table. This tree can contain tip ids that
       are not present in the table, but all feature ids in the table must be
       present in this tree.
   metric : Str % Choices('weighted_normalized_unifrac', 'weighted_unifrac', 'generalized_unifrac', 'unweighted_unifrac')
       The beta diversity metric to be computed.
   n_jobs : Int, optional
       The number of workers to use.
   variance_adjusted : Bool, optional
       Perform variance adjustment based on Chang et al. BMC Bioinformatics
       2011. Weights distances based on the proportion of the relative
       abundance represented between the samples at a given node under
       evaluation.
   alpha : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
       This parameter is only used when the choice of metric is
       generalized_unifrac. The value of alpha controls importance of sample
       proportions. 1.0 is weighted normalized UniFrac. 0.0 is close to
       unweighted UniFrac, but only if the sample proportions are
       dichotomized.
   bypass_tips : Bool, optional
       In a bifurcating tree, the tips make up about 50% of the nodes in a
       tree. By ignoring them, specificity can be traded for reduced compute
       time. This has the effect of collapsing the phylogeny, and is analogous
       (in concept) to moving from 99% to 97% OTUs

   Returns
   -------
   distance_matrix : DistanceMatrix % Properties('phylogenetic')
       The resulting distance matrix.</pre>
